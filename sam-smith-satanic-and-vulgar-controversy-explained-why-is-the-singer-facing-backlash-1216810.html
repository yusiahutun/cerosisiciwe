One TikTok video shows a mother posting about her 5-year-old attending the concert & meeting the singer. This is not normal. This is immoral. Sam Smith wants to normalise this behaviour."</p><br><p>"Sam Smith again, they don't even try and hide their satanic crap. His shows don't have an age restriction [puking emoji] [devil face emoji]," another user wrote, while a third added, "An all ages show with many children present. Sam Smith is a dangerous man, this is profound child abuse." Meanwhile, other users have spoken up for the singer and said, "Musicians have been doing raunchy/revealing/risqué stage shows for f*cking EVER, so don't act like it's something new and uniquely corrupting. The only reason you don’t like Sam Smith doing it is because they're queer and fat, which is very much a you problem."</p><p class=also_read_style><strong>ALSO READ:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# onclick='triggerCommentfollowAlsoClick("article_also_read_click","Sam Smith satanic and vulgar controversy explained: Why is the singer facing backlash?",1216810,"https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/are-sam-smith-and-adele-the-same-person-heres-what-the-unholy-singer-says-about-the-conspiracy-theory-1207002","articlepage","/entertainment/hollywood/sam-smith-satanic-and-vulgar-controversy-explained-why-is-the-singer-facing-backlash-1216810","Content Also read","entertainment","hollywood"),triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Sam Smith satanic and vulgar controversy explained: Why is the singer facing backlash?",1216810,"https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/hollywood/are-sam-smith-and-adele-the-same-person-heres-what-the-unholy-singer-says-about-the-conspiracy-theory-1207002","articlepage","/entertainment/hollywood/sam-smith-satanic-and-vulgar-controversy-explained-why-is-the-singer-facing-backlash-1216810","Are Sam Smith and Adele the same person?

In a year it'll be some other singer you're repulsed by for aaaalll the same sh*t." A third user felt, "Sam Smith putting their finger up and serving non-binary queerness on tour is iconic. Nobody cares when it's for the male gaze or heterosexuality being sexual. Being Queer and sexual is radically politicised. Sexy is an attitude and they're being sexier than most would dare [sparkles emoji]."</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><br><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sbXNpK2ipJyWe6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX528rbjYsKaonF%2Borq550qagraBdqK61rc2immaZnpl6t8HLoJirZZOku7W%2Bzq%2Bcq6upYrK5vMuaoKedlGLEqcWMoqpmrJiaerS1zaCcq2WWlrCqusZmmZqbm6GutLSMamlqbmhmfQ%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./gina-ravera.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Gina Ravera dating?
