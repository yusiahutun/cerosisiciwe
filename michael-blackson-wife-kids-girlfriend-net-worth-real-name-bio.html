The comedian, who has also done some acting and starred in films such as Next Friday (2000) and Meet the Blacks (2016), has proven to be quite versatile in entertainment and is someone to watch out for.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Michael Blackson Biography (Real Name)</strong></h2><p>Not much is known about Michael Blackson before he came to the United States at the young age of 13, except that he was born in Ghana on November 28, 1972. There is also no information about his birth, real name, or the identity of his parents.</p><p>When he arrived in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as an African teenager in the 1980s, Blackson found himself the butt of his classmates’ jokes when he arrived in the 1980s because he was African and spoke differently. Blackson said the jokes offended him at first, but later he grew a thick skin that allowed him to use his accent to tell jokes to anyone who was willing to listen. One of the people he told a joke to was an acting coach at Philadelphia Community College, who encouraged him to take acting classes as he was pursuing a career in comedy.</p><p>Michael Blackson soon began appearing in a number of nightclubs and bars, before later entering well-known comedy competitions such as the Comedy Central Tour in 1992, the Schlitz Malt Liquor Comedy Tour in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania following year, and the Urban Comedy Festival in New York City in 1996. Soon after, Blackson began appearing on BET’s ComicView series and HBO’s Def Comedy Jam.</p><p>His big break came after one of these shows, which featured Ice Cube. The former rapper, who became an actor and film producer, was in the audience and witnessed one of Blackson’s performances in his usual African clothing. This led him to offer the comedian the role of an angry African in the comedy Next Friday (2000), and the rest became history.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Who is Nicholas Hoult – Jennifer Lawrence’s Ex, Who is The Current Girlfriend?</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Michael Blackson’s Net Worth</strong></h2><p>Even though Michael Blackson may not be one of the best-paid comedians out there, he is very well off with a net worth of allegedly around $2 million. The comedian, who has appeared in more than seven films to date, most notably next Friday, where he plays an angry African, has amassed most of his wealth not only through his film roles but also by directing a series of live shows at comedy clubs, universities and other special events in and outside the United States.</p><p>Blackson also has a huge YouTube fan base, where views can generate considerable income.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Does He Have a Wife or Girlfriend?</strong></h2><p>Michael Blackson is not married but has a long-term, recurring relationship with R&B and soul singer Georgia Reign. It’s not clear exactly when the couple started dating, but everything in their relationship seemed to have moved like a fast train because, from the time when both parties began to acknowledge each other in social media to the time when they supposedly got engaged, everything went by very quickly.</p><p>Blackson reportedly planned to make his wife a wife before everything collapsed after he was accused of embezzlement by Reign, who claimed she caught him cheating on her with a fan. Things went further downhill after a video with a naked Blackson naked from the front appeared online. It was first reported that Blackson was filmed cheating with another woman in a hotel room, but the comedian resorted to his social media to say that the video was released by an angry ex who wanted to take revenge on him.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Marina Sirtis Bio, Net Worth, Body Measurements and Other Facts</a></strong></p><p>Unfortunately, there was none of this in Georgia when the two broke up. Since then, however, they have gotten back together and hope to go through with their wedding plans. Georgia Reign, who is originally from Atlanta, Georgia, began her career as a dancer. Her first major performance was a tour with singer Bobby Valentino. She then joined an all-girl music label, which was under contract with a music label owned by legendary R&B musician Babyface.</p><p>During this time, Reign began writing songs for other mainstream artists and earned a considerable amount of money for her work. Her big break came when one of the songs she co-wrote for Chris Brown received a Grammy nomination. Since then she has pursued her own musical career. Some of her most popular songs are: Feel Like A Woman (2013), What Do The Lonely Do At Christmas (2016), Rain (2017), and Mark My Words (2018).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Michael Blackson Kids</strong></h2><p>Michael Blackson is said to have a total of three children from his previous relationships. His first child is named Michael Jr., while his second and third sons, who are twins, are named Niko and Noah. There is no information about the identities of their mothers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51kuqqvx5qcpWWSoa6kt9KopWavmZuybrfInapmn5mnuae%2ByJ6lnWWemsFuw86rq6FlopqurXnNmqSeZZKevHA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kate-middleton-recommended-lifestyle-changes-cancer-treatment.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Princess Kate's lifestyle changes amid cancer treatment">&larr;
