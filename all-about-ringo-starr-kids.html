The two were together from 1962 to 1975, but separated following Starr's affair with American model Nancy Lee Adams and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Cox's affair</a> with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>George Harrison</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 1981, Starr (born Richard Starkey) married actress and model <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Barbara Bach</a>. These days, the famed drummer considers his kids, Bach and his grandkids, the greatest blessings in his life.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I have many blessings, family blessings, my children are blessings. I've got eight grandkids now and a great grandson. They're all blessings. I'm an only child and I look around the table and I go what? All these people are related to me. It's far out. And Barbara's in my life, that's another blessing," he told the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Manila Bulletin</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, fatherhood didn't always come easy to him. "I learned from being a father that I could have been a better father," he told the outlet, admitting that he's a better grandfather: "And I love being a grandfather because you can have all that fun and just give them back."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Ian Cook/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to having families of their own, Starr's children also went on to have their own successful careers, and some of them even followed in their father's footsteps and pursued music.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to how the large Starr clan keeps in touch, the music legend told PEOPLE they have an active text thread, packed with photo updates and lots and lots of emojis. "We've got a family text. It's so great. We're that sort of a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>family in the modern age</a>," he said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keep reading for everything there is to know about Ringo Starr's children.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-zak-starkey-58></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Zak Starkey, 58</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Dave J Hogan/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Starr's oldest child, Zak Richard Starkey, was born on Sept. 13, 1965. Like his dad, he is a talented musician. The Grammy-winning drummer has played and recorded with the legendary rock band <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>The Who</a> since 1996.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A wildly successful musician and co-founder of the record label Trojan Jamaica, Zak has also performed with the likes of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Oasis</a>, Johnny Marr, Paul Weller, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Yoko Ono</a> and Steven Van Zandt, among many others. He started to play in English pubs at age 13 with a drum kit gifted to him by The Who's Keith Moon, who he says "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>was like an uncle</a>" to him due to Moon's close friendship with his father.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Zak and his father are very close, and their shared love for music might be what bonds them above all. "When I was very young there was music all around me in my parents' house," he told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Modern Drummer</a>. "You would go into the living room and find stacks and stacks of LPs. I would spend my days listening to records." Zak also credits his dad for sparking his interest in becoming a professional musician, recalling a T. Rex concert the two attended in 1971 as the defining moment that cemented his dream. "That was it for me," he told the outlet.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Keystone-France/Gamma-Rapho/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Over the years, the father-son duo have collaborated and performed together a handful of times. In 1985, they both took part in Artists United Against Apartheid's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>protest song</a> "Sun City." Zak then joined Starr and the All-Starr Band on tour in 1992 and 1995.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When he was 19, Zak married his teenage sweetheart Sarah Menikides in a secret ceremony, per the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Los Angeles Times</a>. Although the two separated in 2006, they share a daughter, Tatia Jayne Starkey. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Her birth in 1985</a> officially made Starr the first Beatle to become a grandfather, and at the time, he said he was "absolutely delighted" and that "the baby was a little beauty."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Zak and his current partner, Sharna "Sshh" Liguz, have been together for nearly two decades, and they share a young daughter, Luna Lee Lightnin Starkey. Luna was born on March 21, 2021, and her parents <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>got married</a> exactly a year after her birth. "After 18 years together, Luna's umbilical cord kinda tied the knot", the couple joked in a statement to PEOPLE, "but we wanted to make it official and share with our friends and family in the U.S., before doing the same in Jamaica and the U.K.."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Zak was given away by his father, while <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Pearl Jam</a>'s <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Eddie Vedder</a> served as his best man. "Great to be solid with the greatest girl in the world," his <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>wrote on Instagram</a>. "And to celebrate Luna's no1 birthday. Thanks to everyone who came from near far wide abstract and online.

As a drummer, he performed with various indie bands and even briefly formed his own group with his brother Zak called Musty Jack Sponge and the Exploding Nudists. He later retired his drum kit in favor of being a road manager, and then a photographer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2010, Jason married his longtime girlfriend Flora Evans. Evans is a fashion and floral designer and co-founder of the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>jeans brand Superfine</a>, which <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>lists celebrities</a> like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Kylie Minogue</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Kate Moss</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=5>Kim Kardashian</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=6>Victoria Beckham</a>, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=7>Drew Barrymore</a> among its fans. The two share four sons: Louis, born in 1999; Sonny, born in 2002; Rock, born in 2009; and Budy, born in 2011. Louis is an actor, with credits in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=8>Billie Piper</a>'s Rare Beasts, Worse Than Family and Ringo Starr's Big Birthday Show!.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jason prefers to stay out of the limelight, and he and his family rarely make public appearances, nor do they have public social media profiles.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-lee-starkey-53></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Lee Starkey, 53</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>David M.

She also sang backup vocals for "La De Da," a track on Starr's 1998 album Vertigo Man. She currently works as makeup artist and fashion designer, and co-founded a short-lived retail boutique in Los Angeles called Planet Alice, which paid homage to her father's legacy and catered to '60s-inspired fashion.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lee has been in a relationship with musician Jay Mehler, who plays the bass for English rock bands Kasabian and Beady Eye, since 2006. The two live in London, and welcomed triplets Smokey Mehler, Jakamo Mehler and Ruby Tiger Mehler in 2009, according to the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Daily Mail</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lee and Mehler like to keep their personal life rather private. However, it appears that the triplets are already following in their dad and grandfather's musical footsteps; they've even been receiving lessons from the former Beatle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"They're all taking after dad in the music department," Lee told the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Daily Mail</a> in 2017.
