The series, which mixed juicy drama, exciting action and steamy romance, was well-known for featuring a bevy of gorgeous stars, and its slo-mo scenes of bouncy babes and sculpted hunks running along the sandy beaches of Southern California made the Baywatch cast iconic in the early ’90s.</p><p>Surprisingly, Baywatch wasn’t a big hit at first, lasting only one season on NBC before it became an international phenomenon with first-run syndication. The series ran for 12 years, from 1989 to 2001, and at the peak of its popularity in 1996, it was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">watched by around 1 billion (yes, that’s billion with a B!) viewers</a> across 140 countries.&nbsp;</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p>The show’s cast was a revolving door, with various attractive actors filing in and out of lifeguard duty over the course of 241 episodes. The most consistent presence was David Hasselhoff, who played veteran lifeguard Mitch Buchanan.</p><p>By the time the show ended, not a single member of the original cast was left, yet the red swimsuits and sexy atmosphere remain a major pop cultural reference point over 20 years after the show went off the air.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/GettyImages-908453-1-edited.jpg><p>While Baywatch became synonymous with Pamela Anderson’s busty, blonde presence, the ’90s icon didn’t actually join the cast until the third season! Here’s a look back at some of the most memorable members of the original Baywatch cast through the years.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>David Hasselhoff as Mitch Buchanan (1989 — 2000)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/1-2.png><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">David Hasselhoff</a> (often called “the Hoff”) was already famous when he was cast on Baywatch. He had his first major role in The Young and the Restless, playing medical student Snapper Foster on the soap from 1973 to 1982. His popularity grew in the ’80s, when he starred as the enigmatic Michael Knight in Knight Rider. The popular drama ran from 1982 to 1986.</p><p>As Mitch Buchanan, Hasselfhoff was in more episodes of Baywatch than any other actor, and he even starred in the spinoff series Baywatch Nights. The Hoff’s ubiquity in the ’80s and ’90s made him a pop culture icon, but he didn’t just act. He also embarked on a musical career, and released multiple albums. In 2000 he made his Broadway debut in the Jekyll & Hyde musical.</p><p>Now 71, Hasselhoff remains a TV staple. He’s been a judge on America’s Got Talent, competed on Dancing With the Stars and shown up as himself in shows like Just Shoot Me!, Young Sheldon and The Goldbergs. On the big screen, he’s appeared (again often as himself) in Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story, The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, Click, Piranha 3DD, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and multiple Sharknado movies.</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">David Hasselhoff Movies and TV Shows: How ‘The Hoff’ Became a Cultural Icon</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Pamela Anderson as C.J.
