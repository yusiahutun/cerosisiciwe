Books transport you to different worlds, and being able to explore multiple worlds for free is valuable at any age.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If your local library is tech-savvy enough, it may have an app you can use on mobile if you're a member. If not, there are other apps, like Libby, that can help you extend the benefits of your local library.</p><p>The Libby app overtook the popular OverDrive app—which is fully shitting down on May 1, 2023—but just how different are they? And should you give Libby a try? Let's check it out.</p><h2 id=what-is-overdrive-and-why-is-it-no-longer-an-option>What Is OverDrive, and Why Is It No Longer an Option?</h2><p>OverDrive is a <a href=#>mobile app for book lovers</a> that allows users to borrow and read titles from their local library with no fees or subscription costs. However, it has since been discontinued and is fully shutting down on May 1, 2023. OverDrive will be replaced entirely with the modernized Libby app.</p><p>As of February 2022, you can no longer download the OverDrive app from major app stores, including Google, Microsoft, and Apple stores. At the time of writing, the Libby app hasn't officially been approved yet for the Amazon app store, so you can still download the OverDrive app.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Starting in July 2022, OverDrive users were actively encouraged to move their content over to the Libby app. Then, the OverDrive app was completely removed in the second half of 2022 from the Google Play Store, the Microsoft App Store, and the Apple App Store, so no new users were able to download and use OverDrive.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/library-books-stacked-on-shelves.jpg><p>If someone already had the OverDrive app installed on their device, they were able to use it—that is, until 2023. OverDrive pushed for most of its users to transition to the Libby app by the end of 2022, but the app was still receiving support. Fast forward to 2023, and the OverDrive app officially has an end-of-life date of May 1, 2023. After that day, the OverDrive app isn't getting any more support from the company.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But why the switch from OverDrive to Libby? Well, the company says <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">on its FAQ page</a> that it "believe[s] that Libby is the best reading experience for all users." It's simply not practical or helpful to users for the company to continue supporting both OverDrive and Libby. Instead, the company is focusing all of its efforts on Libby to enhance the app with better features for both libraries and its users.</p><p>OverDrive is providing libraries and its loyal users with all kinds of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">resources to help with the transition</a> from the OverDrive app to the Libby app. There's a preparation checklist, live webinars, virtual training sessions, and blog posts breaking down every aspect of the transition as well as Libby's top features.</p><h2 id=what-is-libby>What Is Libby?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/libby-library-reading-app-pulled-up-on-a-tablet-on-a-wooden-table.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>By this point, you've heard of OverDrive's new app multiple times, but what exactly is the Libby app, and how does it work? If you're familiar with the legacy OverDrive app, you can think of Libby as a modernized version with many of the same features.</p><p>In case you ever see "Libby by OverDrive" and get confused, you should know that OverDrive is the company that owns both the legacy OverDrive app and the Libby app. The company opted for a self-titled first app but ultimately went a different route with Libby.</p><p>Libby has the same titles as the OverDrive app and still works with local libraries. You can read and check books out from a distance, which is useful for both librarians and citizens. Providing a virtual platform helps keep everything organized on both ends and allows users to view curated book lists from their local libraries anytime.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=libby-vs-overdrive-what-is-the-difference>Libby vs. OverDrive: What Is the Difference?</h2><p>Both the OverDrive app and the Libby app are products of the same company: OverDrive. While both apps serve the same purpose of borrowing and reading digital content from your library, they look and feel different, offering an entirely distinct user experience.</p><p>Libby has a more modern, user-friendly interface, which is why OverDrive pushed this app instead of its original one. In addition to the features users loved about the OverDrive app, Libby adds new features that make the app a useful pocket companion, even if you usually prefer <a href=#>paper books instead of digital versions</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/libby-app-by-overdrive-home-screen.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/libby-app-by-overdrive-showing-newly-added-titles-and-magazines.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/libby-app-by-overdrive-a-shore-thing-collection-of-books.jpg> <span class=txt>Close</span> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You can start reading books through Libby as soon as your library card is connected and you find your first title to check out. Then, as you read through your checked-out titles, you can see your at-a-glance progress and how far you are from finishing the book.</p><p>It's easy to customize Libby to your preferences. For example, you can set your preferences to only show content you're interested in from your local library based on genre, author, and so on. Or you can also categorize your titles with custom tags to keep your reading list organized.</p><p>With all that said, at the time of writing, Libby is still relatively new and doesn't have all the features that the OverDrive app did, like the ability to recommend titles to your library. However, Libby often has similar features, like "Notify Me," which lets you express interest in a title not yet at your local library.</p><p>As the company can focus more of its efforts on Libby, you can expect many of the fan-favorite features from the OverDrive app to debut on Libby.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=which-platforms-can-you-use-libby-on>Which Platforms Can You Use Libby On?</h2><p>The most popular way to use Libby is in its mobile app form, on either Android or iOS. However, you can also use <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Libby</a> in a Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Microsoft Edge web browser. You can also download <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Libby on the Microsoft Store</a> if you have a Windows device. Or, you can <a href=#>go to the OverDrive website</a> to learn how to sideload the Libby app manually to your Kindle Fire device.</p><p>As mentioned before, the only place you can't officially download Libby at the time of writing is the Amazon App Store. OverDrive has submitted a request to Amazon to add it, but at the time of writing, it hasn't been approved. <strong>Download:</strong> Libby, by OverDrive on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Android</a> | <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a> (Free)</p><h2 id=how-to-get-started-with-libby>How to Get Started With Libby</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/how-to-use-the-libby-app-instructions-on-a-polka-dot-background.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Setting up a new account in Libby is an incredibly simple three-step process, and the rest of your user experience is just as easy. Download the Libby app, and open it. Then, you'll be prompted to find your local library and enter your library card number.</p><p>The Libby app helps you figure out the next steps if you don't already have a library card. Getting a library card usually involves visiting your local branch and showing proof of your name and address to ensure you're in the proper county.</p><p>As soon as you connect your library card, you're free to start exploring. You can view curated collections from your librarians to <a href=#>figure out what to read next</a>, search for specific titles, look through magazines, and so much more. As you check out titles from your library, you can keep track of everything on the <strong>Shelf tab</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=find-your-next-adventure>Find Your Next Adventure!</h2><p>The Libby app makes it easy to stay on top of new books and constantly feed your brain with exciting stories. And the best part? Even if your local library closes, Libby is always open.</p><p>So if you're after a new book late at night or on holiday, Libby has you covered. Plus, with its customized lists for specific genres or themes, you'll never be at a loss for what to read next.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGijopqSrnq3v4yorZ6qlKe2t7GMnaCfnpWnsq%2BvxKxm</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./luke-littler-fifa-pack-walkout-32245598.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Luke Littler has grown adult darts fan 'in tears' after opening another FIFA pack on walk-on">&larr;
