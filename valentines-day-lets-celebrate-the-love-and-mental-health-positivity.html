However, sustaining a happy and healthy relationship requires work and commitment all year long.

Saint Valentine, a Christian martyr, is the source of Valentine’s Day’s amorous connotations. There are many legends and mysteries surrounding the life of Saint Valentine. A commonly held belief holds that Saint Valentine, a priest in third-century Rome, disregarded Emperor Claudius II’s ban on young men getting married.</p><p>Valentine persisted in performing marriages in secret because he firmly believed in the sacredness of marriage and the efficacy of love. On February 14, he was crucified as a martyr for his disobedient actions. According to another version, while Valentine was in prison, he penned a letter addressed “from your Valentine” to a young girl.</p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=#>What Is Limerence?
