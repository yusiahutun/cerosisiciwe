And, although you won't catch her competing on the ice now, she's not slowing down!</p><p>America's favorite ice skating champ won the mirrorball trophy on the sixth season of<strong> "Dancing with the Stars,"</strong> she has an active-wear clothing line, <strong>Tsu-Ya</strong>, and has been named co-captain of <strong><a href=#>Team Kellogg's</a><a href=#>.</a></strong></p><p>toofab's <strong>Rachel Hoffman</strong> caught up with Kristi to talk about everything from her future on "Dancing with the Stars" to her Olympic medal predictions.</p><p>Can we expect to see you on “Dancing with the Stars All Stars?"</p><p><strong>Kristi:</strong> It's hard to say, it was a huge commitment. The first experience was so amazing. Dancing with Mark Ballas – we just had a great time. It was perfect in that stage of my life. Never say never, but it would be hard now.</p><p>We've heard the training schedule is very intense. Break down your daily routine.</p><p><strong>Kristi:</strong> It was between 4 and 6 hours a day. On top of that, we had costume fittings and interviews and press events, so it's pretty non-stop the whole time you're on the show.</p><p>Was it easier for you to transition from ice to the dance floor?</p><p><strong>Kristi:</strong> It was pretty different, and I was surprised at that. I love body movement and expression to music, and I think that helped. But, I think moving your feet in such a different way than what we do on the ice was the biggest challenge. To learn the different essences and styles of each dance, there are so many rules! It was a lot to take in.</p><p>What was your favorite experience from the Olympics?</p><p><strong>Kristi:</strong> I would probably have to say, walking in the opening ceremony and joining all of the athletes from the U.S. team. Just really feeling like a big part of the team.</p><p>What did it feel like to take home the gold medal?</p><p><strong>Kristi:</strong> When I look back, it's still exhilarating. You hear all of the athletes saying that it's a rush of every emotion. It's a lot of relief but also a lot of gratitude to everyone who has helped you get there. Your family, your coaches and your community – anyone who has helped you along the way.</p><p>Who are the front-runners in figure skating now?</p><p><strong>Kristi:</strong> In the women's event, there's an interesting situation with<strong> Yuna Kim</strong> coming back to compete. If she's healthy and skating well, she will be the one to beat. I think <strong>Mao Asada</strong> of Japan is the heir apparent. She's really put in a lot of hard work and has grown so much as a skater in the last four years. I think those two will probably battle it out again. But, I think <strong>Ashley Wagner</strong> has a chance of being on the podium – she's right up there with those girls!</p><p>Who was your biggest inspiration during the Olympics?</p><p><strong>Kristi:</strong> My coach, <strong>Christy Ness</strong>, was a huge inspiration. In figure skating, you have a very tight bond with your coach. As far as other skaters, <strong>Brian Boitano </strong>was a huge mentor and someone who I trained with. I got to see how he prepared and what it really took to reach for your dreams.</p><p>Brian Boitano recently announced that he's gay. How's he doing now?</p><p><strong>Kristi:</strong> I haven't spoken to him directly, but I sent him a message. He's one of my best friends. He knows I'm there for him and I support him all the way. He's a lot of things – he's a champion, a brother, a cook book writer -- it's just a small part of who he is.</p><p>It's been 20 years since the "whacking" incident between Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding. How do you think the attack changed the sport?</p><p><strong>Kristi:</strong> The change you saw was immediately after when there was a rush of interest in the sport. It was pretty intense for a while, but it eventually died off. The sport continued to be popular for legitimate reasons. I don't think it really changed our sport, other than maybe a little more security.</p><p>Tell me about Team Kellogg's.</p><p><strong>Kristi:</strong> I'm honored to be a part of <a href=#><strong>Team Kellogg's</strong></a> as one of their co-captains. It's an amazing group of athletes, and to see their "Great Start" stories is very inspiring. Every time one of the stories is shared, it translates into a breakfast for someone in need. Knowing that up to two-million breakfasts will be served to a child-in-need because of this program is really great.</p><p>Click "Launch Gallery" above to see more famous Olympians, then and now!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2JlfnV7j2pmaW9foL%2Bqv9OiZLKZnZa0tq%2FHomSopKmivaqv0macsZucqsCqwsRmoKeslafDqrHWaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./the-owners-of-the-apollo-theatre-launch-a-crowfunding-campaign-to-help-recover-from-tornado-damage.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Owners Of The Apollo Theatre Launch A Crowdfunding Campaign To Help Recover From Tornado Damage">&larr;
