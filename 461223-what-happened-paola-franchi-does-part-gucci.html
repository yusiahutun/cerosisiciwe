For example, did Paola Franchi get any money? Or, <a href=#>who owns Gucci now</a>?</p><p class=align-left>Paola wasn't entitled to any of Maurizio's wealth because they weren't married at the time of his death. According to her, the relationship was always truly about love rather than money, despite the media's portrayal of her as a glossy gold digg*r.</p><p class=align-left>Speaking of the film, do you know who played Paola Franchi?

But in 2001, she suffered yet another setback when Charlie, her ex-husband Giorgio Colombo's 16-year-old son, committed suic*de.</p><p class=align-left>Franchi was saddened by her son's death, and she used L'Amico Charly, a foundation they founded in his honour, to help her cope. According to Franchi, Charlie was usually a happy youngster. Therefore, his suic*de was unexpected.</p>We believe it was a flash of teen craziness. The foundation collaborates with professionals and psychologists to prevent suic*de, especially in teenagers.<h2>Who is Paola Franchi dating now?</h2><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">As of now,</a> the Italian interior designer is currently single. Paola Franchi and Maurizio Gucci were dating at the time of Gucci's murder in 1995.

However, before he passed away, her acute sense of style and design made it easier for her to connect with him deeper.</p><p class=align-left>After losing him and her son, she penned her memoir L'amore Spezzato, which means "broken love" in English. Since <i>House of Gucci </i>hit theatres, more people are curious about Paola's book for more insight into everything that happened with her late lover.</p><p class=align-left>She is unmarried and hasn't begun a new relationship since Maurizio's passing, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">according to OtakuKart.</a> A relationship isn't her priority right now, but she could start one in the future.
