He is the son of Lori Jenkins and David A. Magee. He was raised alongside his two sisters, Erica and Melonie.</p><p class=align-left>How was Nikko Jenkins as a kid?

On the other hand, Lori was indicted for being a felon in possession of ammunition in 2013.</p><p class=align-left>This might have had a negative influence on their child. As early as 7 years, Nikko was detained for taking a gun to school, Highland Elementary School. Nine years later, he was slapped with a 21-year-sentence for carjacking. He also assaulted a guard on duty twice and participated in a prison riot.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/22b857cbf8b5202b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Luke P from Bachelorette?

But less than two months after his release, he began robbing and murdering innocent people. He <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">committed his heinous crimes</a> between August 11th and 21st, 2013. On August 11th, 2013, a cop discovered two bodies in a white Ford pickup truck. It was parked near a city swimming pool at 18th and F St, in Spring Lake Park. The victims were Juan Uribe-Pena and Jorge C. Cajiga-Ruiz.</p><p class=align-left>On August 19th, 2013, a man from a night shift discovered a dead body outside a detached garage at 18th and Clark St. The body belonged to Curtis Bradford. Curtis had two bullet wounds at the back. Investigations revealed Bradford and Jenkins had posed for a <a href=#>Facebook photo</a> posted the day before.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/bb8099f842a0ca7f.jpg><p class=align-left>Jenkin's last murder occurred on August 21st, 2013. Andrea Kruger's body was discovered by a deputy sheriff. The body was found lying in the road at 168th and Fort St. It had multiple 12-gauge shotgun wounds on the face, neck and shoulder.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b786df4451649b89.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Alex Kompo: Former Siesta Key star's life and latest updates</span></p></a><h2>How was Nikko Jenkins arrested?</h2><p class=align-left>The murderer was arrested on August 30th, 2019, over unrelated terroristic threats reported by his wife. He was later linked to the killings when investigators found CCTV footage from a local gun outlet. The foot showed a woman buying guns matching what was used in the murder incidents.</p><p class=align-left>On November 3rd, 2013, a handwritten letter from Jenkins was submitted to the Omaha World-Herald, prosecutors, and a judge. In the letter, he pleaded guilty to all counts in the four slayings. Additionally, Nikko Jenkins's interview revealed that he did so to offer sacrifices to the Egyptian snake god Apophis/Apep.</p><p class=align-left>It later <a href=# rel=noopener>emerged that some</a> people helped in Nikko's murders. His sister Erica and cousin, Christine Bordeaux, lured his first two victims to their deaths. His mother, Lori, was charged with Bradford's murder and accused of hiding the murder weapon.</p><p class=align-left>Nikko Jenkins' uncle, Warren Levering, helped him rob and kill Andrea Kruger. As a result, he was sent to 40 years in prison but released after 20 years.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/983b40415f243d8a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jeremy Rytky: What you should know about Andrea Barber's ex-husband</span></p></a><h2>Nikko Jenkins' trial and conviction</h2><p class=align-left>Jenkins admitted that he killed the four victims. He also filed a federal lawsuit seeking $24.5 million from the State of Nebraska. He accused them of wrongfully releasing him from prison, stating that his claims of hearing voices from Apophis were ignored.</p><p class=align-left>Nikko also <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">claimed that his problems</a> were caused by mental illness. He said that he had schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. However, after a medical evaluation, he was found to be faking psychotic symptoms.</p><p class=align-left>Is Nikko Jenkins still in jail? Jenkins was sentenced to death by a three-judge panel in May 2017. He was also sentenced to 450 years in prison on weapons charges connected with the murders. He appealed the sentence, but the US Supreme Court refused to hear his appeal.</p><h2>Is Nikko Jenkins still alive?</h2><p class=align-left>Nikko Jenkins is still alive. He was imprisoned at the Nebraska Correctional facility. He is yet to be executed because lawyers say he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">is too mentally ill</a> to be executed.

As a result, it appears it might take longer than expected for his execution to occur.</p><h2>Nikko Jenkins tattoos</h2><p class=align-left>Jenkins is known for his abundance of facial tattoos. Nobody understands what these tattoos mean except him. He has claimed that the tattoos are written in the language of the Egyptian goddess Apophis.</p><h2>Who is Nikko Jenkins's wife?</h2><p class=align-left>Jenkins got married to Chalonda Jenkins on February 6th, 2010, at the Tecumseh State prison.
