After two more pregnancies it became ever more pronounced.</span></p><p><span>Like most women who suffer the problem, this depressed the life out of me. And for two years after Isobel was born (she’s nine now), I worked out with a personal trainer and watched my diet. But while I toned up, I never lost my tum.</span></p><p><span>After Christian, my third child, was born, I more or less gave up. My weight fluctuated between 9st and 10 st (I’m 5ft 3in) and I reconciled myself to having to wear size 12 skirts and trousers to fit around my belly, while the rest of me stayed a svelte size 10.</span></p><p><span>Several years ago, suffering from back pain, I consulted a physiotherapist, who told me that in common with around half of all mothers I was suffering from a diastasis recti.</span></p><p><span>This is when the corset of muscles that wrap around the torso splits down the middle as the baby grows during pregnancy, then fails to knit back together again afterwards.</span></p><p><span>The tissues connecting the banks of muscles on the left and right become thinner and weaker through being stretched during pregnancy, and the unsightly bulge — which can cause so much embarrassment when mistaken for a pregnancy — is, in fact, your innards pushing through the gap.</span></p><img id=i-a6540e4d src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/02/03/article-2551218-1B2E118500000578-500_196x440.jpg height=440 width=196 alt="Week 1.

Now, I am a marvellous 9st and have no problem slipping into skinny size 12 jeans.</span></p><p><span>At the start, I had a 36D bust, 34in waist, 38in hips and an upper thigh measurement of 23in (the same size as Victoria Beckham’s waist a few years ago).<br></span></p><p><span>Now I’m a 36D, with a 31in waist and 36in hips, while my upper thighs have shrunk to 21in.<br>Do you want to lose your mum tum, too? Here’s how I did it.<br></span></p><p><span style=font-weight:700><span>BEFORE YOU START</span></span></p><p><span>First you need to download the MuTu app from the internet.</span></p><p><span>It’s also recommended that you buy special ‘barefoot’ shoes, which &nbsp;are slightly flatter at the back than the front, and designed so that your whole foot engages with the floor as you walk, improving your posture and strengthening your stomach muscles.</span></p><p><span>Wendy explains that as our bodies are thrown forward by even the smallest of heels, we automatically lean back, sticking our bellies out.</span></p><p><span>I wear heels most of the time, but Wendy insisted that ditching them was one of the most important things I could do to get rid of my protruding belly.<br></span></p><p><span>Followers of the plan are then advised to walk for at least 30 minutes a day. You will also need to buy workout equipment, including gym balls, weights, a resistance band and half-moon roller (a foam roller cut in half) and foam step, which are used in balancing and stretching exercises.<br></span></p><p><span>This little lot will cost £50, which on top of £59 for the app, or £79 for the DVD version (yes, my eyes watered, too), and £60 for the barefoot shoes, is not exactly cheap.</span></p><p><span>But it’s still a snip compared to the cost of a tummy tuck, which would set you back around £4,000.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:700><span>THE RULES</span></span></p><p><span>You need to undertake 30 minutes of exercise a day. This comprises ten minutes of core exercises, which are supposed to knit together and strengthen the deepest layer of muscles, the transversus abdominis, in the stomach.<br></span></p><p><span>The exercises include lying on your back with your knees bent, and slowly lifting and lowering each leg to the floor, one at a time, all the time pulling your belly button back to your spine so you’re using stomach muscles to guide your legs.<br></span></p><img id=i-a9660e70 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/02/03/article-2551218-1B2E1AA500000578-590_634x417.jpg height=417 width=634 alt="The MuTu programmes requires you to undertake 30 minutes of exercise a day.

But, trust me, it will be worth it.<br></span></p><p><span>Here’s my MumTum diary...</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:700><span>WHY WON’T MY BLUBBER SHIFT?</span></span></p><p><span>Two weeks in and I could weep with frustration, having lost only 1lb despite cutting out all chocolate and crisps from my diet.<br></span></p><p><span>My little treats are now nuts and a serving of Greek yogurt with a dash of honey.<br></span></p><p><span>I’ve also cut back on carbs and am eating lots of vegetables and&nbsp; omega3-rich oily fish to help build collagen in the connective tissues running down the middle of my core. So, while I’m eating more good stuff, I’m clearly having too much of it. My usual style!</span></p><img id=i-9b2c0e37 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/02/03/article-2551218-1B2E1A9500000578-51_634x298.jpg height=298 width=634 alt="The exercises include lying on your back with your knees bent, and slowly lifting and lowering each leg to the floor, one at a time, all the time pulling your belly button back to your spine so you're using stomach muscles to guide your leg" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>The exercises include lying on your back with your knees bent, and slowly lifting and lowering each leg to the floor, one at a time, all the time pulling your belly button back to your spine so you're using stomach muscles to guide your leg</p><p><span>I’ve had to cut down on caffeine, too. Normally, I ‘chain-drink’ tea around the clock, and the sense of deprivation often leaves me on the verge of tears.</span></p><p><span>But Wendy insists that caffeine is bad news for the pot-bellied, as it increases cortisol, which in turn encourages fat to settle around the&nbsp;middle.</span></p><p><span>And hurrah! By the end of the week I notice a small indent in the blubber around my belly button.<br>Could it be that those simple exercises of just pulling in my belly button while lifting my legs up and down are actually doing something and my stomach is beginning to pull in? Apparently so.<br></span></p><p><span style=font-weight:700><span>PIZZA AND PROSECCO ARE MY DOWNFALL</span></span></p><p><span>It’s week four and I’ve moved on to daily ‘intensive’ exercises, consisting of 20 minutes of squats and lunges, pulling a resistance band apart, slamming a ball to the ground, then lifting it above my head, and&nbsp; — finally — hopping from side to side with the resistance band tied around my feet.<br></span></p><p><span>The exercises leave me sweating and breathless. It’s impossible some days to fit in everything, including my walk, what with work, running a home and being mum to three children.<br></span></p><p><span>If I miss a couple of days, I try not to fret. I’m sure Wendy would approve, having explained that stress leads to the production of cortisol, which in turn encourages fat to settle around the tum — so worrying would only make my tummy bigger.</span></p><p><span>I manage to resist the temptation to have so much as a bite of the chocolate muffins I bake for a school cake sale.</span></p><p><span>But my willpower weakens at the weekend when visiting friends in Somerset, where pizza, prosecco, chicken and chips and fry-ups are all on the menu.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:700><span>TORTURE BY SPINACH JUICE</span></span></p><p><span>By week six, I step on the scales and discover I’m 9st 4lb. I’ve lost 4lb! People have started noticing, too. My size 8 sister comes to stay for my eldest son’s birthday and tells me I’m looking great — and&nbsp; my stomach is visibly flatter.<br></span></p><p><span>I haven’t had backache for several weeks and a niggling pain in my right knee has vanished, too.<br>While my stomach below the belly button feels smaller, the top half still protrudes. I shudder at the thought this is my organs making a bid for freedom and vow to work harder.</span></p><p><span>Another two weeks pass and I’ve lost another 2lb. But I’m beginning to panic I won’t meet my target, so I take Wendy’s advice and try celebrity diet expert Jason Vale’s five-day juice diet.</span></p><p><span>I’m going to have to go without solid food for five days, and have vegetable-based juices instead.<br>It’s torture. Opening the fridge to retrieve another bottle of spinach and avocado mush, I find myself salivating over raw sausages.</span><br></p><img id=i-9bc60e3b src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/02/03/article-2551218-1B2E1A0D00000578-81_634x716.jpg height=716 width=634 alt="Helen says: 'The exercises leave me sweating and breathless.

However, this still takes me down to 8st 11lb — the lightest I’ve been in a decade.</span></p><p><span>After five days of what feels like extreme deprivation, I crack and indulge in a creamy curry and fizzy wine. So, by the end of the following week, I’ve crept back up to 9st 1lb.<br></span></p><p><span>The good news, though, is that&nbsp; the exercises seem to be doing the trick as friends keep telling me how slim and toned I’m looking.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:700><span>TEMPTED BY CHEESECAKE</span></span></p><img id=i-a89c0e63 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/02/03/article-2551218-1B2E199D00000578-231_306x570.jpg height=570 width=306 alt="She added: 'Looking in the mirror, the stretchmarks are still there, but at least I can see the outline of my long-buried abdominal muscles'" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>She added: 'Looking in the mirror, the stretchmarks are still there, but at least I can see the outline of my long-buried abdominal muscles'</p><p><span>Ten weeks in and I’m getting used to walking ‘properly’, making sure my body is aligned from ankle to shoulders, stacked on top of the one below, not leaning forward or back.<br></span></p><p><span>But my good intentions keep failing me on the food front (a slice of Nigella’s Nutella chocolate cheesecake when visiting friends) and my weight is creeping back up, so I’m doing more exercise.</span></p><p><span>The final stages of the workout programme are tough, involving more weight-lifting and aerobic exercise — but, with just two weeks to go, the clock is ticking.<br></span></p><p><span>I make a resolution to get up at 6am each morning for the next fortnight to fit in exercises.</span></p><p><span>Then, 12 weeks in, my weight is down to 9st — which is a total loss of 8lb — and I’m delighted with my new flat stomach. Yes, I’m a long way from a six-pack, but since my ambition was to ditch the smock top, I’m really pleased.<br></span></p><p><span>The gap between my stomach muscles measures less than two finger-widths. At the outset, it was four. As even Wendy has a one finger-width gap, I’ll settle for that!<br></span></p><p><span>I feel confident that I’ve tackled a long-standing problem, and not merely on a superficial level.<br></span></p><p><span>If I want to keep my tum trim and lose more weight, Wendy’s advice is to continue doing three to four workouts a week and to avoid sugar, processed food, alcohol and caffeine as much as possible.<br></span></p><p><span>And while I still love heels, I try to do the school run in my flats.</span></p><p><span>Looking in the mirror, the stretchmarks are still there, but at least I can see the outline of my long-buried abdominal muscles.

I liked your jelly belly.’</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaJ6Voq6quI6aqa2hk6Gybn6UbmhraWhklm651KaksmWkqrquxYxqaWaxlZa%2FtHnLqKqtZWFnerixxKSqZoGkqHqjwcypZKatnah6r7HVnqlmq5ies7V5oa6rZntxg3q0wMCrq2acmamwqbXNoGShoZedeqmxxKWqZpulpcBuwMSaZaGsnaE%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./strictly-nadiya-bychkova-daughter-so-tall-rare-photos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nadiya Bychkova's daughter is so tall in rare snaps">&larr;
