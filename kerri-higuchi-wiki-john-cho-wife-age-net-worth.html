He also addressed the wedding in the interview and shared that he and his wife had their wedding in Northern California on New Year’s eve. John revealed, “It was a lot of fun. We had it in Northern California on New Year’s Eve. I was just fuzzy with affection that night. But it was a big deal! It’s like putting on a one-night-only show. You’re the producer and director and the star, so you’re busy. And you’re the host, so you’ve got a lot going on. I’d like to do it again.”</p><p>John Cho has always spoken fondly of his wife, Keri in the Glamour interview. He shared that she was mostly a stay-at-home mom, but she was a good actor and he learned a lot from her.</p><p>He told Glamour, “My wife was confident in a way that I was very attracted to. She knows who she is. I knew nothing about that. I was so unsettled at that age and so scatterbrained.
