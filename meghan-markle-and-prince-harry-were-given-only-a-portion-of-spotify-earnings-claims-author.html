He claimed before the couple “mutually agreed” to cut ties with the platform, they were not paid the entire $20 million they could’ve earned.</p><p>In the three years after the royal couple announced working with the <a href=#>music</a> and podcast streamer, they only produced two projects. This was an Archewell Audio Christmas special and Meghan’s Archetypes podcast. The podcast only ran for one series of 12 episodes.</p><p>The series features interviews with the likes of <a href=#>Paris Hilton</a>, Serena Williams, and Mariah Carey. In their conversations, the 42-year-old and her guests would “explore and subvert the labels that try to hold women back and “dismantle them with action.”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Opinion: Prince Harry and Meghan will be backed into a corner if they lose royal titles</a></p><p>Bill Simmons, a podcast executive at Spotify later blasted Harry and Markle, calling them “grifters.” But a source who is close to the pair told Scobie: “There have definitely been a mountain of lessons learned when it comes to the business side of thing.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fighting-to-tell-their-side-of-the-story>‘Fighting’ to tell their side of the story</h2><p>However, Harry and Meghan were <a href=#>reportedly “embarrassed” at being “fired” from their deal</a>, a source has previously claimed.</p><p>The source said: “There have definitely been a mountain of lessons learned when it comes to the business side of things. Yes, they’ve made mistakes, but they have big plans for their next endeavor.</p><p>“Practically everyone in <a href=#>Hollywood</a> is talking about how Harry and Meghan’s empire is crumbling.”</p><p>CEO of United Talent Agency, Jeremy Zimmer, weighed in and said the Dutchess of Sussex is not “a great audio talent, or necessarily&nbsp;any kind of talent.” He added: “And, you know, just because you’re famous doesn’t make you great at something.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-has-teased-her-hollywood-comeback>Meghan has teased her Hollywood comeback</h2><p>It comes as the former <a href=#>TV</a> actress has teased her comeback to our screens after she stepped back from acting following her marriage to Harry, 39.</p><p>After the fall out of their Spotify deal, Markle <a href=#>is set to make her own ventures into the world of work</a> away from Harry. She explained on the red carpet at Variety’s Power of Women: “[I want to make] things that make people feel – I was going to say ‘good,’ but it’s more than that, things that make people feel something, right? And feel a sense of community.”</p><p>However, it doesn’t mean she’ll stop working with her husband completely.</p><p>“We have so many exciting things on the slate. I can’t wait until we can announce them, but I’m just really proud of what we’re creating,” she said.</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Meghan Markle’s memoir wouldn’t be as ‘interesting’ as Harry’s, friend confesses</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2aAcLnEoJ%2Bapl2irrO3y55kmqaUYr2ztc2cnGagkae%2FunnWnqmeZZeew6a6jKilpbFdlnqxu9GtoKimXaSzbr%2FPqKuinqlisqK%2BzaKloKtdmLmitcysZJqtpJ28s3s%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./armando-bacot.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Parents of Armando Bacot, Bio, Age, Net Worth, NBA Draft, Tattoo, Height">&larr;
