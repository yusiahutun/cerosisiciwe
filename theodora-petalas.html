On the one hand, Stefano is open about his relationship but, Theodora is a bit private about her personality revelation. As per her Linkedin profile, she is known to be born in Greece but now resides in London.</p><p>She has worked as a junior strategist but has never come to the media to discuss her relationship with the athlete. Stefanos Tsitsipas, the 24 years old Greek tennis player, had a marvelous entry with 2-0 up going into the 3rd set at the 2021 French Open.

In the city of Delft on April 24, 2004, when Petalas was just nine years old, she served as a bridesmaid, leaving a lasting impact on her life. This experience played a vital role in nurturing her fascination and appreciation for diverse international cultures and traditions.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u1322348db361a52ad7e485c17ad44f5e><span class=ctaText>Read Also:</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>John Paul Mac Isaac Biography</span></a><p>She completed her schooling at Queen’s Gate School and went to New York University for her Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) and Master of Science (M.Sc.).

While it is unclear when they began their relationship, it is well-understood from the talks and interviews of Stefanos Tsitsipas that the couple started meeting through their friends and families in New York. Also, in previous interviews, Stefanos Tsitsipas stated that he fell in love with her (without hinting at the name) the moment he saw her. “I liked her very much, but I was shy then …..,” he said in 2021.</p><p>Earlier this (nearly two years ago) in New York, Stefanos said he asked her for a date and went out to Brooklyn to snap some photos. She liked it, and I did take some pictures, which became my favorite day of my life. Again from his other statement to the media,</p><p>“It’s a little difficult for us, because she lives in London……She comes to some tournaments to support me……She is my best friend… We talk every day….”</p><p>This time, it was clear that Petalas was residing in London, and Tsitsipas, no doubt, had to travel to the world for tournaments. Still, the couple manages it well to maintain their long-distance relationship.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u4da4c8f84b885cf441a500f982aa6fa6><span class=ctaText>Read Also:</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Ken Goldin Biography</span></a><p>Previously, Tsitsipas was linked with the U.S. Open semi-finalist Maria Sakkari. The reason behind the bond between them was their mothers and their friendship. Both of their mothers had been friends since they were 15 and were tennis players. Although the mothers created doubt that both of their adult kids were dating each other, the two adult children came forward to speak on their behalf. In the end, they clearly know that none of them are dating each other though they know and inspire each other.</p><h3>Theodora Petalas Net Worth</h3><p>Theodora Petalas is earning well because of her well-flourished job profile and marketing strategies. She has lots of experience handling the P.R., marketing field, and branding positions. Indeed, she might earn as good as her rumored and romantic lover-boy, Stefanos Tsitsipas.</p><span class=simplesocialtxt>Facebook</span> <span class=simplesocialtxt>Twitter</span> <span class=simplesocialtxt>Reddit</span> <span class=simplesocialtxt>WhatsApp</span> <span class=simplesocialtxt>Pinterest</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZa5tbTYrKeyZpOkunDAx56mnaeilnqxsdOao5qrXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./beyonce-coachella-2018-wardrobe-malfunction.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Watch Beyonce's Coachella 2018 Wardrobe Malfunction">&larr;
