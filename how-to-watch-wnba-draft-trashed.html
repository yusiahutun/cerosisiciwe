If you’re a hoops follower, you’re likely wondering <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>how to watch the WNBA draft</a> live for free. Luckily, there are plenty of ways to do so, which we’re about to break down for you.</p><p>The Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA) draft is an annual draft where WNBA teams select <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>college players</a> and profesional women’s basketball players to add to their rosters. This draft has been going on since 1997, making the 2024 WNBA draft the 29th in the league’s history. This year, it’ll take place on April 15 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in Brooklyn, New York.

The league considers anyone who is slated to graduate from college in the three months following the draft to be a “graduate,” since the draft typically takes place in April, which is before commencement. These requirements have been upheld since at least the 2014 draft.

There are three rounds in the WNBA draft and each one includes 12 picks. The top four picks of the first round are determined by the Draft Lottery, which took place in December 2023. The four teams that did not make the playoffs in the 2023-2024 season get to participate in the lottery. This year it’ll be the Indiana Fever, Phoenix Mercury, Los Angeles Sparks, and Seattle Storm. The Fever won the lottery for the second time in franchise history, so they get the top pick in this year’s draft. The Sparks, the Mercury, and the Storm follow the Fever in that order.</p><p>After the four lottery picks have their turn, teams pick in the inverse order of the standings from the regular season. That means teams at the bottom of the standings from the 2023-2024 season will get to select picks first and the top-ranking teams will go last. One catch is that teams can trade their draft picks with each other, which has the potential to alter the order and number of picks per team. For example, this explains how the Sparks have both the second and fourth draft picks this year.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=which-team-will-draft-caitlin-clark>Which team will draft Caitlin Clark?</h2><p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Caitlin Clark</a> is predicted to find her new home with the Indiana Fever, since the Fever get the first pick and Clark is the presumed first overall draft pick.
