But I think a lot of people who [you] would maybe expect to hate on it actually love it and acknowledge they love it, because there’s just something so American about it or something. There’s something just classic about it.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">To that, Kelce laughs and jokes: “I don't know how I did it, because she was not into sports.
