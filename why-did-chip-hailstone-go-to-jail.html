Different families and&nbsp;individuals&nbsp;live&nbsp;life&nbsp;on the edge, having to hunt despite the harsh climate. There is no&nbsp;law&nbsp;enforcement and no government.</p><p>The&nbsp;population&nbsp;is only a&nbsp;couple&nbsp;of a hundred&nbsp;people&nbsp;(sometimes less). The place is isolated, risky, and downright intolerant. However, the teams have proven repeatedly that they can push limits and make it out there.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>Life Below Zero</a>&nbsp;is a huge success in the world of&nbsp;reality&nbsp;TV. Since it premiered in 2013, the show has earned five Emmy nominations and won five Emmy Awards. Watching a <a href=#>group of&nbsp;individuals</a>&nbsp;struggle to put&nbsp;food&nbsp;on the table and stay alive in below zero climatic&nbsp;conditions&nbsp;is awe-inspiring, to say the least.</p><p>The show is so popular that it has earned a spin-off called&nbsp;Life Below Zero – Next Generation. This will come up somewhere in the future. Producers promise more thrill, wonder, and awe. Going by the original series, it is hard to doubt them.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is&nbsp;Chip Hailstone?</h2><p>One of the notable&nbsp;cast&nbsp;members from&nbsp;Life Below Zero&nbsp;is Chip and&nbsp;Agnes Hailstone. The two, alongside their seven children, call Alaska home. They are also at the heart of the&nbsp;reality&nbsp;series. It is incredible to watch the&nbsp;family&nbsp;survive in the&nbsp;Alaskan wilderness.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Chip Hailstone</a>, born on March 5th, 1969, is not an&nbsp;Alaskan native&nbsp;in Montana.</p><p>However, as it turns out, the&nbsp;Alaskan&nbsp;landscape has always been attractive to him. Therefore, when&nbsp;Chip Hailstone&nbsp;was only 19, he made his way there, never to go back home. He planned to tour the&nbsp;town&nbsp;of&nbsp;Noorvik&nbsp;temporarily, but he fell in love with the landscape that he decided to stay there permanently.</p><p>The TV&nbsp;star&nbsp;soon after met his wife, Agnes, who is a native to the land. They fell in love with each other and decided to tie the knot. The&nbsp;couple&nbsp;has been together ever since, with their union resulting in five&nbsp;daughters&nbsp;and a grandchild.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Good morning a few months ago…. <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/PFZlvclBvz</a></p>— Chip Hailstone (@HailstoneChip) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">May 31, 2019</a></figure><p id=ent-10>While&nbsp;Hailstone&nbsp;is not born in&nbsp;Alaska,&nbsp;Agnes&nbsp;certainly is. She’s been living at&nbsp;Noorvik&nbsp;all her life. She even has ancestral ties with the&nbsp;land&nbsp;dating back 1000 years or more.</p><p id=ent-10>Her commitment and passion for Alaska are perhaps why she found&nbsp;Chip&nbsp;to be a worthy soul mate. All their&nbsp;kids&nbsp;make occasional&nbsp;appearances&nbsp;on the show, and you bet they’ve all learn survival tactics in the harsh wilderness.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Working with the proper tools makes for great work. <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/5jT1QOpWP9</a></p>— Chip Hailstone (@HailstoneChip) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">May 24, 2019</a></figure><p id=ent-10>The&nbsp;family&nbsp;lives by the banks of Nordic’s Kobuk River (approximately 19 miles)&nbsp;north&nbsp;of the Arctic Circle. The family occasionally moves as far as 90 miles from their home, hunting for game.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why Did He Go To Jail?</h2><p>Many&nbsp;Life Below Zero&nbsp;fans&nbsp;don’t know this, but&nbsp;Chip Hailstone&nbsp;was away from TV for an entire&nbsp;season&nbsp;(season 10).</p><p>Not much was said about his disappearance, and when he resurfaced later, things carried on and moved swiftly that his&nbsp;absence&nbsp;became blurred. Most&nbsp;people&nbsp;to date cannot even remember his little&nbsp;time&nbsp;off from the popular&nbsp;reality&nbsp;show. So where was Hailstone?</p><p>Chip went to&nbsp;jail&nbsp;for 15&nbsp;months&nbsp;amidst filming&nbsp;Life Belo Zero. According to many sources, he was incarcerated in 2017 on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">two&nbsp;counts of perjury&nbsp;and one count of giving false&nbsp;statements to police&nbsp;officers</a>.</p><p>Chip allegedly lied to the&nbsp;police&nbsp;over and over again about his case. He once claimed that a state trooper from&nbsp;Alaska&nbsp;assaulted his 17-year old daughter.</p><p>According to the&nbsp;reality TV star, the police&nbsp;officer&nbsp;had a&nbsp;submission&nbsp;hold on his teenage daughter as she tried to speak to him. When the court asked the&nbsp;Alaskan trooper’s partner to confirm or deny the claims, your guess is right – he denied them.&nbsp;</p><p>As was reported by the rural news leader, the Anchorage Daily News, Hailstone claimed that he had two confrontations with Trooper Bitz, which led him to believe that his family was no longer safe. However, the court eventually determined that Hailstone had issued a false testimony and committed perjury.</p><p>All these were added to the false claim charges for making false accusations against Trooper Bitz.</p><p>All along, Chip’s public defender, Jay Hochberg, insisted that the testimony that his client provided was accurate and did not deserve a conviction for perjury.</p><p>The lawyer even claimed that the Alaska state police had manipulated the audio recording that they submitted as evidence during the trial.</p><p>At some point, Hochberg filed for a motion requesting the court for a new trial as the initial one had been too manipulated and had significant claims of error for his client to receive any fair trial.</p><p>Hochberg gave it his best to keep Chip from going to jail. In his motion for a new trial, he brought in a forensic audio expert, who tried to convince the court that the audio that the troopers presented was interrupted.</p><p>According to the forensic expert, the tape was stopped for about eleven seconds. According to Hailstone, the paused part of the conversation is where the troopers issued threats to his family and caused him to believe that his family was no longer safe.</p><p>Hailstone and his public defender argued that there was scientific evidence to show that the tape was inauthentic. This, he claimed, should allow him another chance to present his case afresh in court.&nbsp;</p><p>In yet another case, the&nbsp;Life Below Zero&nbsp;star&nbsp;claimed that a&nbsp;resident&nbsp;on&nbsp;Noorvik&nbsp;pointed his&nbsp;gun&nbsp;at his daughter over a misunderstanding. He got a three-year&nbsp;probation&nbsp;sentence&nbsp;for it, but he later appealed the ruling.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=und dir=ltr><a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/jcAPlSlEzA</a></p>— Chip Hailstone (@HailstoneChip) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">May 31, 2019</a></figure><p>During&nbsp;Chip Hailstone’s&nbsp;15&nbsp;months in jail,&nbsp;Agnes&nbsp;and the&nbsp;children&nbsp;held down the fort. They kept hunting, with his wife claiming that Chip needed to “come home to fresh food” after those&nbsp;months behind bars.&nbsp;Trust her to keep her word as she knows all there is to know about making a living in Alaska.&nbsp;</p><p>Chip Hailstone encountered misfortune early&nbsp;in his TV career, but that proved to be but a small bump in the road. With a net worth of $10,000, mainly from&nbsp;Life Below Zero, it is safe to say that Mr. Hailstone has done well for himself thus far. And we suspect that he has barely scratched the surface.&nbsp;</p><p>If you are a fan of the show, you might wonder what happened to Andy Bassich’s wife Kate. <a href=#>Find out here</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLjOrKqynpmasW%2BvzqZmsKCpYrGqsIycn6KoXZ2uqrjSraannV2cvG7AzmahmqGcZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-to-reset-a-ring-doorbell.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How to Reset a Ring Doorbell">&larr;
