"The Bravo sleuths are super sleuths, but women as a whole, pretty good at sleuthing. If I think my husband is cheating, and I can walk right over to his side of the bed when he's asleep and can check his phone because clearly she had his password. When you drop your phone it doesn't unlock, so she had to unlock it. She unlocked it, if the story is true, to check it at that moment, why, if you suspect anything at any time."</p><p>"I don't believe that, I don't believe that's how it happened," she continued, referring to the phone incident. "I believe that was propped and sent, I don't know maybe she thought the day before, and she told production, and off they went. If you think your partner is cheating and you have access to their phone 24 hours a day, wait until they are asleep, wait until they go to the bathroom, go look at the phone, she had the password. So I don't buy the, 'it fell out of his pocket and I looked at it.' ... I think that was set up for the whole thing."</p><p>Harris added, "I know people aren't going to love that, but I stick to it."</p><p>The publicist also said it's worth noting that the majority of the cast -- aside from <a href=#><strong>James Kennedy</strong></a> and Rachel -- were or are actors.</p><p><a href=#><strong>TooFab</strong></a> has reached out to Madix's reps for comment. It's worth noting, the Scandoval discovery happened after the season had already wrapped filming, but before they had taped the reunion. Cameras did pick up to briefly capture some of the fallout, after TMZ reported on the affair.</p><p>For what it's worth, in the past, Madix has denied the affair was faked or that production knew about it before it was exposed.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:62f8e13c-c921-4ffe-b6e5-3e7b74807be9 data-container-ref=toofab:article:fe042e1a-270c-44d9-9216-d329bb49d90c data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/27/5by4/2024/03/27/27279db42b4f4e719425a39f8ace5200_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Hulu / Bravo</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Lisa Vanderpump Reveals Which Is the 'Messier' Cast: Pump Rules or Vanderpump Villa (Exclusive)</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Meanwhile, on the podcast episode, Harris went on to open up about interacting with Sandoval amid the fallout from the scandal. She claimed that the TomTom bar owner's main priority was his and Leviss' "brand" rather than how it would affect them as people, specifically Leviss' mental health.</p><p>She then recalled a phone call she said she had with Leviss, Sandoval, and his then-publicist.</p><p>"Immediately talking to him and listening to him and all he kept saying is 'my brand, our brand,'" she said. "I was like, 'Excuse me, you're thinking of a brand, I'm thinking of a human thatâ€™s about to go into a mental health facility, but you do you.'"</p><p>Harris also claimed that Leviss told her that she needed "some time alone," away from Sandoval, but he wouldn't give it to her. She said she called Sandoval, and asked for him to "leave [Leviss] alone for 24 hours," but he "could not do it."</p><p>"The minute we hung up, he was on the phone with her again," Harris said.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:f343277e-f5b4-40b3-81a8-144aa0e1e4c3 data-container-ref=toofab:article:fe042e1a-270c-44d9-9216-d329bb49d90c data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/7d/5by4/2024/03/19/7dd1e3e349164afeaaa21e47c82f3365_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Bravo</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Jax Taylor Tears Into 'Disgrace' Tom Sandoval During Vanderpump Rules Return</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>She went on to claim that Sandoval was upset with Leviss getting treatment at the mental health facility, and flipped out when he couldn't communicate with her.</p><p>"He got so frustrated, and he blew a gasket, and was like, 'I'm not going to protect her anymore, I'm out here by myself, it's them against me, I'm not going to do this anymore, I'm going to do what I have to do,' then hung up the phone,'" Harris said, claiming it was the last time they both heard from Sandoval.</p><p>Leviss' affair with Sandoval came to light in March 2023. It was exposed on the Season 10 finale of Vanderpump Rules, and blew up on the three-part reunion.</p><p>Leviss entered a mental health facility following the reunion, and it was later announced that she would not be returning to Vanderpump Rules for Season 11. Despite her decision not to return, she's been a frequent topic of discussion so far on the season as the cast deals with the fallout of Scandoval. However, Leviss has been reacting to the episodes as they air on her podcast, Rachel Goes Rogue.</p><a id=gallery-link-92ddbedc-6f25-4503-8d0a-fe7f57e22457 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:92ddbedc-6f25-4503-8d0a-fe7f57e22457 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:fe042e1a-270c-44d9-9216-d329bb49d90c data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/95/4by3/2024/01/18/95bfc95d84c44b92ad6ff649dd00f1a9_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3V7j21maWlfp66ktMSlZKWdpp7AtHnPrpmloZOewLV5wJyarquVqHqivsiapZplnZaxqsSMrJytrJmjtG7Bz2aqmqaUpMOiuIyrnK%2BdkaF8</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-ghislaine-maxwells-secret-husband-meet-scott.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Ghislaine Maxwells secret husband?
