Here’s what she said that caused a mini tumult I’m 5′ 6″ and I weigh 120 pounds so I’m not thin but I think that’s why women identify with me and I’m loved by men. I’m just a normal person.</p><p>Hmmm, where to start? We can’t give our opinion without ambiguity but here’s what a fan had to say about it.

If you want a slim figure you have to aim for anorexia.</p><p>This 46-year-old woman is an inspiration to many with her toned and enviable physique. Her hard work and dedication have enabled her to maintain a body that some 20-year-olds would love to have. If you’re curious about what it takes for someone of this age to achieve such results, then look no further! With the right approach and commitment, you too can attain the same level of fitness as this star.</p><p>Her diet consists mainly of lean meat, vegetables, and healthy carbohydrates. It works hand in hand with training sessions that she does with two coaches each coming with different approaches that keep her invested. One of his coaches David Kirsch says they do boards, pumps, boxing, and a little bit of everything. Meanwhile, his other coach Tracy Anderson says ‘We just freestyle’ we do 3-pound arm weights with butt and thigh moves that incorporate the core.
