There she studied English literature and after taking a gap year to film the final movie in the franchise, she graduated in 2014. Looking back on the experience, Emma says that once everyone got over the initial shock of seeing a celebrity, she had a very normal college experience.</p><p>"I've never even been asked for an autograph on campus. I threw a party for nearly 100 students and not a single person put a photo on Facebook. Anyway, even if I was being given a hard time, I wasn't going to wuss out of university because someone said 'Wingardium leviosa' to me in a corridor, or 'Ten points for Gryffindor.' I've been dealing with the media since I was nine. If I can't stand up to a few people giving me a hard time, it's a bit pathetic, really. I've had so much worse," Emma told the <a href=#><u>Sunday Times' Style Magazine</u></a>.</p><p><strong>2. </strong><a href=#><strong>Yara Shahidi</strong></a></p><p>"Grown-ish" star Yara Shahidi has spent the past few years managing her acting career while getting her degree from Harvard University. In May 2022, Yara graduated and received her diploma from the institution's Social Studies & African American departments.</p><p>"It's surreal to have finally hit this major milestone. I've known I wanted to go to college since I was four. By 17, I knew exactly what I wanted to study, so to see that come to fruition is a goal fulfilled," Yara told <a href=#><u>Vogue</u></a>.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:455c8e63-52f4-4d07-82d3-7073d0d3cc69 data-container-ref=toofab:article:dbe8c032-f443-4909-958f-3f0f75f3e9d6 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/93/5by4/2022/04/28/93f7a1c96d41489e998f78231cf234cf_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">10 Celebs Who Have Gotten Very Real About Their IVF Journey</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>3. </strong><a href=#><strong>Brooke Shields</strong></a></p><p>Brooke Shields was already a well known model and actress when she enrolled at Princeton University to study French literature. Unfortunately, her experience ended up being a little less than ordinary as she says she was often followed by paparazzi on campus. Despite the distraction, she graduated with honors in 1987.</p><p>"The paparazzi tried to sneak onto campus, dressed like what they thought college students looked like, and follow me around. The students were great and they alerted the school and me if anyone saw anybody suspicious. One photographer hid in a vent to photograph me walk to a class; another attempted to bribe a Mathey College freshman to take a camera into the showers and snap me in the nude. They would have been in for a surprise if they tried, because I had taken to showering in a one-piece bathing suit!" Brooke <a href=#><u>wrote</u></a> in her memoir, "There Was a Little Girl: The Real Story of My Mother and Me."</p><p><strong>5. </strong><a href=#><strong>Mindy Kaling</strong></a></p><p>Mindy Kaling received a bachelor's degree in playwriting when she graduated from Dartmouth College in 2001. Since graduating, Mindy's been back to campus more than once. In 2018, she returned to give the graduating class' <a href=#><u>commencement speech</u></a>, during which she was given an honorary doctorate. She even stopped by <a href=#><u>her old dorm room</u></a>! Later, Mindy returned to campus again to talk with students as part of research for future shows, chatting with members of the Dartmouth Jack O' Lantern, the school comedy magazine.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:0c6a6977-ac33-4664-8126-040808ca4ff7 data-container-ref=toofab:article:dbe8c032-f443-4909-958f-3f0f75f3e9d6 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/af/5by4/2020/05/18/afc95b2301d64b85b4aab6024937f06e_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">25 Celebrities Who Decided to Change Their Name</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>6. </strong><a href=#><strong>Lupita Nyong'o</strong></a></p><p>While Lupita Nyong'o completed her undergraduate degree at Hampshire College, she received her MFA from the Yale School of Drama. She <a href=#><u>beat out 950 other applicants</u></a> to join the prestigious program's class of just 16 people. It's clear that the program was an important part of Luptia's life as she thanked the school in her Oscars acceptance speech when she won Best Supporting Actress for her role in "12 Years a Slave."</p><p>"I want to thank my family, for your training, and the Yale School of Drama as well, for your training," she <a href=#><u>said</u></a> in her speech.</p><p><strong>7. </strong><a href=#><strong>John Krasinski</strong></a></p><p>In 2001, John Krasinski graduated from Brown University with a bachelor's degree in English. During his time in school, he joined the Out of Bounds sketch comedy group -- which he says completely changed his life.</p><p>"I went in for the audition, and my entire life changed. Nope, not because I got in, not because I started acting. It was through that group that I found my way into this community.

She ended up majoring in comparative religion before graduating in 1997.</p><p>"I just thought it was so fascinating...And it was the comparative study of religion, so I got a really good, like, buffet of everything…As an organizing principle, I think religion is so fascinating in its ability to bring people together and its ability to, you know, incite war and violence and just to really create order and get people to do, you know, things you want them to do in the name of God. It's interesting to me," Rashida told <a href=#><u>NPR</u></a>.</p><p><strong>9. </strong><a href=#><strong>John Legend</strong></a></p><p>John Legend graduated from high school when he was just 16 and received offers from numerous Ivy League schools. After <a href=#><u>turning down Harvard</u></a>, he decided to enroll in the University of Pennsylvania, graduating in 1999 with a degree in English with a specialization in African American literature. He returned to the campus in 2014 to address the graduating class as a <a href=#><u>commencement speaker</u></a>.

She graduated in 2003 with her bachelor's degree in psychology. Looking back, Natalie says she’s glad there was no social media at the time, which could have made going to school more complicated for the actress.</p><p>"I think I was really lucky to have been there before social media…So I went to school with no Facebook, no Instagram, no cameras on phones…I was really able to go about my business and not have it documented for public consumption. Which was really lucky 'cause, guess what? It's good to, like, make mistakes and do stupid things when you're a teenager and young adult and not have it haunt you forever," Natalie told <a href=#><u>People</u></a>.</p><p><strong>11.</strong><a href=#><strong> Jenny Slate</strong></a></p><p>Jenny Slate received her bachelor's in English literature from Columbia University in 2004. She says she partially chose the school because of the comedy scene in New York City. Even as an actress Jenny says she's still constantly using her degree.</p><p>"I use my education a lot, because I tend to make fun of the things that I love. Like any book that’s kind of like 'A Room with a View,' where there's a young, female protagonist who's about to have a sexual awakening and just cannot handle it," Jenn told the <a href=#><u>New York Times</u></a>.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:8010076f-ea48-431b-aa9c-0cf07b1d0cb0 data-container-ref=toofab:article:dbe8c032-f443-4909-958f-3f0f75f3e9d6 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/29/5by4/2022/03/04/29bac5a8566e41e3b7981affa238c8d5_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Celebrity Names We've Been Mispronouncing For a Long Time</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>12.</strong><a href=#><strong> Conan O'Brien</strong></a></p><p>In the early 1980s, Conan O'Brien attended Harvard University, where he majored in history and literature.
