Facing skepticism and reluctance from potential clients due to her gender, Laura invents a fictional male superior named Remington Steele. The plan takes an unexpected turn when a charming and enigmatic con man, played by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pierce Brosnan</a>, assumes the role of Remington Steele.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Stephanie Zimbalist as Laura Holt</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/1_f03c66.jpg><p>As the lead character, Stephanie Zimbalist’s portrayal of Laura Holt was both empowering and endearing. A skilled detective, Laura navigated the challenges of a male-dominated profession with intelligence and determination.</p><p>Born in 1956 in New York City, Zimbalist starred in several television movies, including&nbsp;The Gathering (1977),&nbsp;Centennial (1978),&nbsp;The Golden Moment: An Olympic Love Story (1980)&nbsp;and&nbsp;Tomorrow’s Child (1982). She also appeared in feature films including The Magic of Lassie (1978) and&nbsp;The Awakening (1980).</p><p>Then Zimbalist took on the role of Laura Holt in Remington Steele. Her on-screen chemistry with Pierce Brosnan kept viewers coming back week after week.</p><p>When the show ended, she continued to act. She won an Emmy award and garnered a Golden Globe nomination for her starring role in Caroline? (1990). She went on to do a slew of television movies including&nbsp;The Story Lady (1991)&nbsp;alongside&nbsp;Jessica Tandy; Incident in a Small Town (1994)&nbsp;opposite Walter Matthau; and Stop the World, I Want to Get Off (1996). In the 2000’s she appeared in&nbsp;The Prophet’s Game (2000), Borderline Normal (2001)&nbsp;and Malpractice (2001). She also did guest appearances in shows like Crossing Jordan.</p><p>Most recently she starred in the in the 2023 movie Lucky Louie, a comedy in which she plays a pastor.</p><p><strong>Did you know?</strong> While things looked steamy on screen, Zimbalist was not always happy playing opposite Brosnan. “When I took this series,” Zimbalist told The Washington Post, “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">I was sold a bill of goods</a>. I wasn’t always very happy.” Part of the challenge was that the spotlight was always on her hunky costar, Pierce Brosnan.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Pierce Brosnan as Remington Steele</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/2_af3034.jpg><p>Pierce Brosnan’s suave and charismatic performance as Remington Steele added a layer of intrigue to the show. Prior to stepping into the shoes of the charming con man, Brosnan had gained recognition for his role in the series The Manions of America and the detective show The Professionals.</p><p>People often wonder if Brosnan is British or Irish. He was born in 1953 in Ireland, but he moved to England at a young age, so he’s able to master both accents. While he was in Remington Steele, he was asked to replace Roger Moore in the James Bond films but the television studio wouldn’t let him out of his contract. He then formed his own company, Irish Dreamtime. He did later play the role of James Bond in GoldenEye (1995),&nbsp;Tomorrow Never Dies (1997),&nbsp;The World Is Not Enough (1999)&nbsp;and&nbsp;Die Another Day (2002).</p><p>In 2017-2019 he starred in the TV series The Son. He also starred in the movies Mamma Mia (2008) and the sequel Here We Go Again (2018). His other big hits included The Thomas Crown Affair and Mrs. Doubtfire.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=#>‘Mrs. Doubtfire’ Turns 30! See the Beloved Cast Then and Now</a></strong></p><p>Brosnan has always been very hard working and he’s showing no signs of slowing down.&nbsp; He appeared in three movies in 2023, The Last Rifleman, Fast Charlie, and The Outlaws. In 2022 he was in the King’s Daughter and Black Adam.</p><p>In his private life, Brosnan was married to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cassandra Harris</a> in 1980, and they remained together until her death in 1991. They had three children—Charlotte Christopher and Sean. Brosnan then married his second wife <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Keely Shaye Smith</a> in 2001 and together they had two children—Dylan and Paris.</p><p>Sadly, Brosnan’s daughter Charlotte died in 2013—due to ovarian cancer&nbsp;(which is what also caused the death of her mother). He told Entertainment Tonight, “I held the generous, strong, beautiful hand of my <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">first wife Cassie</a> as ovarian cancer took her life much too soon. [Then] I held the hand of my funny, wonderful daughter Charlotte before she, too, died from this wretched inherited disease.”</p><p>Brosnan is very close with his four surviving children.</p><p>“<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">My fatherly instincts&nbsp;</a>are purely my own,” he told&nbsp;Esquire&nbsp;in 2017 of his parenting. Pierce was raised by his maternal grandparents as his father left when he was a baby and his mother moved to London to work when he was just 4. “They relate back to no one, because there was no one. I only met [my dad] the once. … I had a Sunday afternoon with him.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Doris Roberts as Mildred Krebs</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/3_eebc6c.jpg><p>While Laura and Remington were the heart of the show, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Doris Roberts</a> brought her comedic prowess to the character of Mildred Krebs, the agency’s receptionist. Born in 1925 Roberts had guest appearances in many roles before Remington Steele. She was in Alice, St. Elsewhere, The Love Boat and Mr. Belvedere.</p><p>After Remington Steele, Roberts had guest star appearances on several shows including&nbsp;Desperate Housewives,&nbsp;The King of Queens,&nbsp;Grey’s Anatomy, and&nbsp;Law & Order: SVU. But her most iconic role was that of Marie Barone in Everybody Loves Raymond.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=#>Where Are They Now: The Cast of ‘Everybody Loves Raymond’!</a></strong></p><p>Roberts passed away in 2016 at the age of 90.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Remington Steele: James Read as Murphy Michaels</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/02/1_b9d196.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">James Christopher Read</a> was born in 1953 in Schenectady, New York. He performed in regional theater before moving to Los Angeles in order to break into television and film. In 1982 Read was cast as Murphy Michaels in Remington Steele. He left that show after the first season, but he left his mark.</p><p>After Remington, Read played George Hazard in the beloved miniseries North and South (1985). Wendy Kilbourne, who starred opposite Read in the series, became his love interest both on and off screen. They married soon after meeting and are still married today.</p><p>Read had roles in several movies including Beaches (1988) and Eight Men Out (1988). Most recently, Read has spent the last ten years as a series regular on the soap opera Days of Our Lives.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Janet DeMay as Bernice Foxe</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/02/2_bdb4ed.jpg><p>Born in 1957, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Janet DeMay</a> played the part of Bernice Foxe on Remington Steele.
