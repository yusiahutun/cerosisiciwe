Welcome to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://harpersbazaar.com/40-is-the-new-40 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="40 Is the New 40" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">40 Is the New 40</a>, a series of essays about—and for—a generation rethinking what it means to get older.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="body-dropcap css-803sjt emevuu60">What does it mean to be in your 40s these days? No one really knows anymore. Look at famous geriatric millennials Beyoncé, Britney Spears, Natalie Portman, Serena Williams, and Meghan Markle, who all turned 40 within the past year. Would you call any one of them “middle-aged”?<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If baby boomers led us to believe that there’s one path in life—get married, buy a house, have 2.5 children, fade quietly into complacency, then retire—it’s clear that millennials aren’t following the script. I’ve been thinking about this pretty much every day because I turned 40 too not long ago and, with a friend, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.hellogloria.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="started a newsletter, Gloria" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>started a newsletter, Gloria</u></a>, about this phase of life.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For one thing, the visual cues are confusing. Even though we’re aging, many of us don’t want to see it on our faces. As a society, we got serious about <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/24/fashion/24skinside.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=sunscreen class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>sunscreen</u></a> in only the past few decades, and some of us are playing catch-up after too much sun (and tanning bed) exposure. It feels like we <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/10/business/skincare-industry-trends-beauty-social-media/index.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="care more about our skin" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>care more about our skin</u></a> now than ever before. Maintaining a youthful appearance has become almost a nationwide anxiety, and injectables have gone from a Hollywood secret <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/life-sciences/our-insights/from-extreme-to-mainstream-the-future-of-aesthetics-injectables data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="to mainstream" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>to mainstream</u></a> seemingly overnight. While I have yet to see many wrinkles, I have developed an unwelcome constellation of age spots on my face. Do I want to erase them?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While it may be hard for others to discern our age, that doesn’t mean we don’t feel it. “This is probably silly, but you have to take care of your body,” says Crystal Anderson, cofounder of creative agency <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://averygoodjob.co/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="A Very Good Job" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>A Very Good Job</u></a>. “Forty comes at you fast. In your 20s and early 30s, your body wasn’t physically keeping the score. And now my body tells me how mad it is at me. It’s like, ‘I know what you did last night. It was wild and I’m not down.’ That doesn’t necessarily even mean drinking; it could just be Popeyes at 11 o’clock.”<br></p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>We were told we could have it all. But nobody mentioned that we would have to totally redefine what “it all” looked like.<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Like me, other “elder millennials” I’ve spoken with in the fashion industry are charting their own path when it comes to clothes at this point in their lives. All the major trends of my high school and college years—low-rise pants, baguette bags, thin eyebrows, and halter tops—are currently being recycled and revisited by new generations. But we’re not asking “Can I wear that?” or “Should I wear that?” so much as “Do I want to wear that again?” Flares: yes. A scarf as a shirt: maybe not. Forget about “mom jeans”—I often catch myself wearing the same trends and shopping at the same stores as women half my age.</p><p>This nostalgia for the recent past extends to TV and movies too. Hollywood has issued new iterations of ’90s and aughts classics, like The Matrix, The L Word, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Sex and the City, Queer as Folk, and Jurassic Park, and many recent docuseries have focused on how major female figures (such as Britney Spears, Pamela Anderson, Janet Jackson, Brittany Murphy, and Tonya Harding) were mistreated by the media back then— almost as if to say, “We know better now.”<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But these fashion and cultural shifts are signs of something happening on a bigger demographic level. For one thing, millennials are now <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/04/28/millennials-overtake-baby-boomers-as-americas-largest-generation/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the largest living generation" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>the largest living generation</u></a>, and given the declining birth rate, our power is unlikely to be usurped any time soon. We are the first to be “digitally native”; IBM released the personal computer a little over a month before I was born. Aside from our tech acumen, most millennials’ lives have been defined by economic forces.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 e1jtuqk11"></span><h5 class="css-13733z5 e1jtuqk13">Celebrities Turning 40 in 2022</h5><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 e1jtuqk10"></span><img alt="celebs born in 1982" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1657219133.jpg title="celebs born in 1982" width=1000 height=1500 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We were told we could have it all if we worked hard enough; after all, we grew up during the boom times of the ’80s and ’90s. But nobody mentioned that we would have to totally redefine what “it all” looked like. We graduated into a questionable economy that came crashing down in 2008, while we were shouldering plenty of debt, forcing many to delay or forgo the typical trappings of adulthood: <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.businessinsider.com/us-millennials-student-loan-debt-major-barrier-to-home-ownership-2022-1 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="buying a house" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>buying a house</u></a>, getting married, having kids, even purchasing a car. The crush of the pandemic has only further challenged our financial outlooks. As Michael Hobbs wrote for the Huffington Post in an<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/poor-millennials/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" in-depth investigation" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u> in-depth investigation</u></a>, “millennials are facing the scariest financial future of any generation since the Great Depression.” Once <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://time.com/247/millennials-the-me-me-me-generation/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=maligned class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>maligned</u></a> as “lazy, entitled narcissists” and the “me me me generation,” we live in a constant state of precarity.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“We’re hard on ourselves because we’re measuring our life goals relative to what our parents did,” says psychiatrist <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://ellenvora.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ellen Vora" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Ellen Vora</u></a>. “[We should] give ourselves grace when we are not checking certain boxes at the same time as earlier generations did.”</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 e1jtuqk11"></span><h5 class="css-13733z5 e1jtuqk13">Celebrities Who Turned 40 in 2021</h5><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 e1jtuqk10"></span><img alt="beyoncé performs during the 2022 oscars in a tennis ball yellow dress" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1657217976.jpg title=Beyonce width=1000 height=1500 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It is impossible to paint everyone in this age demo with the same brush. After all, there are more than 70 million of us. Within millennials, vast discrepancies exist. For instance, the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.businessinsider.com/racial-gap-typical-wealth-black-vs-white-millennials-2021-4 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="racial wealth gap" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>racial wealth gap</u></a> is significant, with white older millennials holding much more wealth than their Black counterparts. A little over <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.apartmentlist.com/research/millennial-homeownership-2021 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="50 percent of millennials" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>50 percent of millennials</u></a> have been able to purchase a home, compared with 62 percent of boomers and 60 percent of Gen X at the same age—and more are deciding to remain child-free. According to a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/11/19/growing-share-of-childless-adults-in-u-s-dont-expect-to-ever-have-children/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="new Pew Research survey" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>new Pew Research survey</u></a>, “Some 44 percent of non-parents ages 18 to 49 say it is not too or not at all likely that they will have children someday, an increase of 7 percentage points from the 37 percent who said the same in a 2018 survey.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Turning 40 doesn’t mean a clean break from one phase of life to another, but it does signal the beginning of a shift that can be both mental and physical. “In my experience, and speaking with women, around this age is a time when there is that sense of loss that your peak reproductive years are kind of behind you,” says Dr. Ariadna Forray, director of the Center for Wellbeing of Women and Mothers at Yale School of Medicine. “And the near future is menopause.”</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 e1jtuqk11"></span><h5 class="css-13733z5 e1jtuqk13">Celebrities Who Turned 40 in 2020</h5><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 e1jtuqk10"></span><img alt="kim kardashian attends the los angeles premiere of the kardashians on hulu in 2022 wearing a form fitting silver gown" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1657216885.jpg title="Kim Kardashian" width=1000 height=1500 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“The idea of turning 40 felt so heavy, like I was officially old. I had to keep reminding myself: Don’t be weird; 40 is not old,” says Anderson. “It’s just another age. You don’t turn 40 and break a hip. You can continue to do everything. And anyone who tells you otherwise is full of shit and needs to be removed from your space.”<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There’s a stereotype that women of a certain age become invisible, but it seems unlikely that women of this generation will accept that or stand for being mocked for trying to appear young. For one thing, we simply cannot afford to shrink away in silence. We have to stay relevant to remain employed. (Retirement? Who, me? With whose money?)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There’s also the fact that we basically invented oversharing on the internet. “Mommy blogging,” as it’s derisively called, preceded modern social-media sharing and the momfluencer economy—and brought hard truths about parenting out into the light, making women feel less alone. I already see the same when it comes to getting older, with increased conversations about everything from surprising <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.hellogloria.com/essays/facial-hair-removal data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="perimenopause symptoms" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>perimenopause symptoms</u></a> to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://slate.com/culture/2022/05/angela-garbes-essential-labor-parenting-book-review.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="caregiving burnout" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>caregiving burnout</u></a> to transparency about <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/zanromanoff/fillers-injectables-kylie-jenner-dr-ourian-dr-diamond-kim data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=injectables class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>injectables</u></a> and other beauty procedures.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Sure, many of these conversations may be happening in closed groups on Facebook (the ultimate old-timer platform), but I see them leaking out into the mainstream media too. Hollywood could hardly be called supportive of “mature” women, but there are signs of a shift, thanks to the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://deadline.com/2022/06/everything-everywhere-all-at-once-a24-box-office-record-2-1235042399/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="box-office success" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>box-office success</u></a> of Everything Everywhere All at Once and critical acclaim for shows like Big Little Lies and Pamela Adlon’s Better Things. The hard parts of aging still exist, but they don’t need to remain a shameful secret.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>“I had to keep reminding myself: Don’t be weird; 40 is not old.”<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Something about being 40 makes you realize that although you still have time to change your life and for new things, that time is limited. Your fertility window is closing. Perhaps you have new financial constraints. But you can still surprise yourself: I’ve just started running and volunteering within the past year, and I know plenty of people who’ve pursued new careers. “Turning 40 for me meant focusing on being remembered for who I am, the work I do, how I move—not any one job or title. In my 20s, my job and where I worked was very, very much tied up with my identity. Now, less so,” says Simone Oliver, the global editor in chief of Refinery29.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If we’re lucky, at 40 we have an equal number of years in front of us as we do behind us. We’re beginning to gain the wisdom of perspective. One of the hard parts of being in midlife is realizing the paths we could have taken but didn’t; we’re old enough now to own those choices. “I wanted to get my license by 40. It did not happen,” says Oliver, a native New Yorker. “That was no one else’s fault. I’m not trying to get down on myself, but I am an adult, so there’s no one else to blame here. Either you prioritized it or you didn’t.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“It’s in our 40s that we’re seeing the impact of different lifestyles,” says Vora. “By the time we’re here, it’s really hard to go back and reverse the impact.” Time is real, and it comes for us all, but she adds that it’s never too late to try something new. “If you’re feeling defeated, like, ‘I now realize I should have been taking better care of myself,’ I think it’s also a great time to start. The best time to plant a tree is 50 years ago, and then the second-best time is today.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Like the 101-year-old female narrator in the film Titantic, I feel like I have plenty of stories to tell—if only any young people would care to listen. We talk about living through history when it comes to the pandemic, but in my lifetime I’ve seen our first Black president elected, gay marriage pass, the Berlin Wall fall, and antivirals change AIDS from a death sentence to a manageable condition. I remember life before social media, smartphones, 9/11, and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. We are living through unprecedented times now, yes—but it’s not like things were exactly precedented before this. And if the past few years have felt like a uniquely complicated time to hit midlife, at least there are millions of other people facing something similar.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“For anybody having a really heavy reflection as they’re turning 40, just recognize there’s so much conspiring to make things feel hard right now,” says Vora. “Do not despair; let it be something that we can make meaning from.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfmMKtwNSrnGiZZGWBd3%2BPb2xopZmhuaa6zaKYpatdqcKzuoxtZ2g%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./the-weeknd-wiki-net-worth-age-height-girlfriend-bio-family.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Weeknd Wiki, Net Worth, Age, Height, Girlfriend, Bio, Family">&larr;
