Fans feared the duo were splitting in terms of their brand as the <a href=#>Duke took more solo trips</a> without the TV star by his side. Now a source has come forward and claimed Harry and Meghan’s absence at certain events is down to them not being on the same page.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-and-harry-s-absence-is-down-to-their-different-plans>Meghan and Harry’s absence is down to their ‘different plans’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-19-at-12.56.52-1024x556.png><p>An insider told Woman Magazine that Harry is focusing on different things to the Duchess of Sussex. They say any instance when there’s a Harry and Meghan absence when they attend events is down to the mom-to-two concentrating on herself and her brand.</p><p>They said: “There’s very much a feeling that Harry wants to concentrate on charity work and his family, while Meghan is much more concentrated on moving her brand forward.”</p><p>The couple stood down as senior working royals in 2020. They moved to Canada for a brief time before finding their forever home in their <a href=#>Montecito mansion</a> in LA. But their lucrative deals following the split from The Firm has had both highs and lows.</p><p>Meghan and Harry were united when they sat down in a bombshell interview with <a href=#>celebrity</a> pal Oprah the following year. They also came together for their <a href=#>Netflix</a> series, Harry & Meghan. In both instances, they talked about their experience in the palace, while making accusations against the <a href=#>royals</a>, William and Kate.</p><p>They bagged a reported $20m for Spotify, but that ended after just 12 episodes.</p><p>However, experts have warned their brand, three years on, <a href=#>is seen as ‘toxic’</a>. PR experts in their field have advised the couple to separate in order to gain success.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-feels-lost-after-latest-blow>Meghan feels ‘lost’ after latest blow</h2><p>It was only in June when Meghan and Harry’s deal with <a href=#>Spotify</a> was axed. The music and podcast giant announced the deal had met its end after Meghan’s Archetypes podcast had one series.</p><p>The Netflix deal, rumored to be worth $100m, is believed to bring multiple ventures. Meghan and Harry have already brought out their own six-part series, as well as the Prince’s Invictus Games project.</p><p>The 38-year-old then signed a four-book deal with Penguin Random House. He released his memoir Spare in January this year, but there’s no other news on what the other supposed three other titles will be.</p><p>But what about Meghan? Last month, reports swirled that the 42-year-old was signing a huge deal with Amazon’s Audible – rival to Spotify. But last week, the company came out to flat-out deny the claims. There is no deal for Meghan. An insider claimed she felt <a href=#>“lost” after the blow</a> of losing Spotify.</p><p>Meghan had applied to trademark Archetypes after the initial success of the podcast. However, she was forced to withdraw the application this summer.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-harry-broke-silence-over-meghan-s-absence>Harry broke silence over Meghan’s absence</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-19-at-13.57.19-1024x517.png><p>Prince Harry was seen alone at Inter Miami CF and Los Angeles Football match this year, as well as travelling to Singapore in August. But the Duke followed Meghan along to a Beyoncé concert over the summer, so the reason for Meghan not showing up wasn’t all about mixing business and pleasure.</p><p>Then, he attended the WellChild Awards in September, the same event the pair were on the bill for last year. The royal, who is fifth in line to the British throne, turned up on his lonesome. One of the children had asked where the duchess was and Harry was forced to respond. He explained Meghan was “very upset” she couldn’t make it, but they had a busy week.</p><p>Following on from that, Harry’s Invictus Games also came in September. Originally, the Duchess was set to attend the entire event with her husband, but ended up arriving days later <a href=#>covered in $40k glam</a>.</p><p>She did apologize for her tardiness, and said she stayed home to make their kids lunch and do the school run.</p><p>It seems either Harry and Meghan absence in upcoming events will continue if they move in different directions.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmppX2V%2FcLLEmqmsZZiWv7PFjJqlnWWdmrSprc1mpKiumaO0brXNZpuinpaav6a602aboqqVmMGqu82sZJqrXai1pnnFqJquq5WoerC6jKGcq6uVobNw</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kevin-jonas-nick-jonas-joke-about-jonas-brothers-future-on-snl.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kevin Jonas, Nick Jonas Joke About Jonas Brothers' Future on 'SNL'">&larr;
