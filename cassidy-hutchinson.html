When Donald Trump wanted to be escorted to the Capitol, she revealed information about the incident. Donald Trump’s interactions with service agents on January 6, 2021, as well as his response to threats made against his vice president. Donald Trump, however, refuted all of Cassidy Hutchinson’s charges prior to her testifying. In a tweet, Donald Trump said, “I hardly know who this person, Cassidy Hutchinson, is, except from the many terrible things I’ve heard (a total fake and ‘leaker’),” he said. Before Hutchinson gave a testimony at the beginning of the 28th of June 2022 hearing,”</p><h2 id=what-was-revealed-in-cassidy-hutchinsons-testimony class="rb-heading-index-1 wp-block-heading">What was revealed in Cassidy Hutchinson’s testimony?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tellygupshup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image-106.png><p>When Mr. Trump exited the stage of his event at the Elipse, Cassidy Hutchinson revealed that he had the thought that his security guard would escort him to the Capitol. Because his fans were waiting for him there, he wanted to travel to the Capitol.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2.wp.com/tellygupshup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image-107.png><p>But when Mr. Robert Engel (Bobby Engel), Mr. Trump’s top Secret Service agent, told him that he couldn’t go to the Capitol for security concerns, Donald Trump lost his cool and erupted. Cassidy said that when Robert Engel said they didn’t have access to accomplish it, Mr. Trump responded angrily and strongly. Mr. Bobby claims that Cassidy disclosed that. Irate is a good word to characterise Donald Trump’s actions. Cassidy Hutchinson then resumed her testimony by revealing that Donald Trump reacted to Bobby by telling someone to “carry him to the Capitol immediately” because he was the president. Mr. Boby Engel did not, however, accompany Donald Trump to the Capitol. However, Cassidy’s testimony reveals that Donald Trump’s behaviour exploded. When Rep. Liz Cheney was present, Cassidy disclosed more. R-Wyo asked her additional questions about the “House Jan. 6 Committee.” In his testimony, Cassidy claimed that Donald Trump then reached for the wheel of his Bullet Proof vehicle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2.wp.com/tellygupshup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image-108-1024x576.png><p>“Sir, you need to take your hand off the steering wheel,” Bobby commanded, grabbing his arm. They will return to the West Wing at Bobby’s request. We won’t be visiting the Capitol. Then Miss Cassidy testified in her testimony that after witnessing Bobby say these things, Donald Trump rushed up and grabbed Bobby by the throat. Following Cassidy’s testimony in court, it was made public in the media that security had refused to accompany Trump to the Capitol because they had informed the White House that many of his fans were armed with weapons such firearms, knives, spears, and Ar-15 assault rifles. Trump showed no signs of fear. According to Hutchinson, he informed the Secret Service, “I don’t f-cking care if they have firearms.” They are not in my life to harm me. Remove the f-cking magazines. Embrace my folks. From here, they can march to the Capitol.</p><h2 id=wiki-biography-of-cassidy-hutchinson-age-early-life-amp-education class="rb-heading-index-2 wp-block-heading">Wiki, biography of Cassidy Hutchinson (Age, Early Life & Education)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i3.wp.com/tellygupshup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image-109-1024x768.png><p>Let’s now discuss the woman’s history who just provided testimony for the “House Jan 6 Committee.” Cassidy Hutchinson was born in Mercer County, New Jersey, between 1995 and 1996, according to her Wikipedia profile.
