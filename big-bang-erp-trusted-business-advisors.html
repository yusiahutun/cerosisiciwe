With the help of ERP, organizations can carry out more accurate and efficient operations. Gabriel Tupula, the CEO of Big Bang ERP recognized this need and raised a team of experts who work in hands with the organizations to achieve exceptional business improvements by implementing, customizing, and supporting the world’s leading cloud-based business solutions.</p><p>Gabriel’s cumulative <a href=#>experience is in information systems, software development</a>, and internet marketing allowing him to be a creative problem solver and a results-oriented project manager. As an analytical thinker, Gab is uniquely able to see the big picture and create a roadmap to tangible results – plus he has the drive and ability to cross the finish line.</p><p>“Experience is a torch that can only enlighten the one holding it”</p><p>Big Bang ERP – Trusted Business Advisors is a boutique consulting firm that helps businesses optimize and streamline their operations with NetSuite, Rootstock, Salesforce, FinancialForce, Mavenlink & ServiceNow systems as well as custom cloud-based software applications.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Big Bang ERP</a> is a boutique consulting firm that helps businesses optimize and streamline their processes by implementing cloud solutions for the following processes: Financial (ERP Systems), Production (PSA, MRP and SCM systems), Relations (CRM and HCM systems), and Promotion (MAS&nbsp; systems).</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Their Approach- Design Your Business Today</strong></h3><p>Big Bang ERP has worked with many clients and saw a recurring theme time and time again: there seemed to be a lack of understanding of how systems within a company work together. We approach your business holistically – meaning we don’t just look at the problem you are facing today, but also at trends, expected growth, check gates, and the business systems roadmap to optimize your plan.</p><p>“If you are able to leverage the capabilities of each of your systems together, you will find your organization streamlined with less manual processes.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Their Services-</strong></h3><p>Big Bang offers professional services and enterprise advice (BPR – Business Process Review) related to several cloud systems including Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRP), Information Technology System Management (ITSM) systems and other applications. Services include implementation, integration, migration, customization, support, training, and even business systems advisory (BSA). Big Bang ERP analyzes its clients’; business needs and recommends the best solution from its vast portfolio of cloud solutions and provides the necessary services related to the products. Our leading core products include NetSuite ERP, Salesforce CRM, Mavenlink, Rootstock ERP, ServiceNow, FinancialForce… and more!</p><p>“We are different in the portfolio we offer and by being customer-focused rather than a VAR (Value Added Reseller), we are a service provider and a partner to our customers to accompany them in their digital transformation and to support their growth – as a partner.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>The Big Bang Experience™</strong></h3><h2 class=wp-block-heading>At Big Bang ERP – Trusted Business Advisors, they use the proprietary 7-step methodology to maximize the success of your cloud business transformation.</h2><p>It ensures that the project team ramps up effectively, needs are documented, solutions are proposed and reviewed, development work is validated and your system is deployed smoothly. The Big Bang Experience™ is the standard delivery methodology for any Cloud Solution and the steps outline the main activities involved in the delivery of each phase. Even though the 7-steps are structured, they are flexible to remain within your budget and timeline.&nbsp; It is important to approach every cloud transformation with an agile mindset and a dynamic scope.</p><p>During The Big Bang Experience™, expert consultants work with you to define your goals, scope, and objectives with a Project Statement. This phase starts with a Kick-Off Meeting between stakeholders to identify the roles and contributions and to address the risks and issues involved.</p><p>Create a game plan for your business. Big Bang ERP starts each engagement with an on-site review of your business. This ensures our team of Certified Consultants has a clear understanding of how your business is operating.</p><p>During this phase, the project team determines how to implement the re-engineered business processes, which processes are “out of the box” and which ones will require customization by one of the team experts.</p><p>This is where the Experts at Big Bang ERP – Trusted Business Advisors dig in and create magic for our customers. This is when they Build & Configure the Cloud Solution to meet your business’s financial, language, shipping, and customer-facing needs.</p><p>“Measure twice, cut once”. One of the most critical factors in any Cloud Solution implementation is testing. The Big Bang Experience™ includes a variety of testing processes to ensure that the cloud solution conforms to specifications and meets requirements.</p><p>After all the preparation, planning, and development, we’re ready to deploy your solution. This is when your Cloud Solution goes from concept to reality.</p><p>After deployment, we get a Project Sign Off and gather any feedback from you. Like your organization, all cloud solutions continue to evolve. Big Bang ERP ensures you always have the support you need to grow.</p><p>The Business System Advisory is tailored to your company’s unique needs – ranging from a quick conversation to a full-scale Enterprise Architecture. Investing early in your business saves you time, resources and unpleasant surprises down the road, something we can all agree is worth it.</p><p>“Big Bang ERP is here to guide you through more than your cloud implementation – we are your business advisors.”</p><p>Your key stakeholders will work with the company’s team of experts to validate, refine or create a strategic plan for your organization. Based on the information the company will collect, Big Bang will document your processes, requirements, pain points, and objectives. This deliverable serves as the blueprint of the solutions that you require and will be supporting you every step of this journey, from identifying and selecting a solution to validating its proper implementation.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>The Team-</strong></h3><p>All of the employees of Big Bang ERP have been handpicked and are subjected to rigorous physiological testing at the hands of various experts.
