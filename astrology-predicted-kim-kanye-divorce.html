In my astrology class many years ago, my teacher <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Annabel Gat</a> printed out their charts. Did we assess they would ultimately break up? Yes. Was I happy to hear this? No.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">See, I've always rooted for Kimye (personally and as an astrologer) and after almost a decade of watching their romance play out, it's hard to imagine that their marriage has ended — no matter what the haters say. They gave my Gemini Sun hope that we could be understood, seen, and loved throughout our endeavors!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So, upon hearing about their divorce, I (along with many other astrologers) turned to the stars to understand the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>gossip circulating all over the internet</a>. Here are the key dates in their relationship timeline: The pair met in 2003, became friends in 2008, started officially dating in 2012, got married on May 24, 2014, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Kim filed for divorce</a> in February 2021. By looking at the astrological aspects that were happening throughout the course of these dates and applying them to their personal birth charts, as well as their composite chart (the chart of their relationship itself), we can discover a lot about Kimye's relationship — and why it ultimately didn't work out.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-astrological-compatibility></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Astrological Compatibility</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Before we get into the nitty-gritty, here are the basics. Kim was born on October 21, 1980, at 10:46 AM in Los Angeles, California. That means she has a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Libra</a> Sun, and a Pisces Moon, with a Sagittarius ascendant. Kanye was born on June 8, 1977, at 8:45 AM in Atlanta, Georgia. That means he is a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Gemini</a> Sun, Pisces Moon, and has a Cancer ascendant.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In looking at their "Big 3" (sun, moon, and ascendant), they're extremely compatible — which is part of what makes their breakup so hard for astrologers to swallow. Both have <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>air sign</a> Suns, which means that they love to converse and exchange ideas. Their Moon signs (which denote their emotional nature) are both in the water sign Pisces, which means they understand each other's moods and memories, and can intuitively understand each other. It also means that they wanted to build a home and family together. Their ascendant signs (Sag and Cancer) connect by a quincunx, which is a 150° angle formed by planets five signs apart with orbs of up to 3°. My takeaway? While they are very different people, they were meant to learn from each other.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-cosmic-destiny-and-split></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Cosmic Destiny and Split</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">No matter how one spins it, Kim and Kanye were meant to be a couple based on the times they met and got married. When they met, Kanye's Saturn aligned with transiting Jupiter in Leo, which means he felt an immediate attraction and connection. As for Kim, she was having luck around romance, as Jupiter connected with her North Node of Destiny, which was in Leo. (For those who don't know, the Nodes of Destiny are the lunar nodes of the Moon which cite the karma and fate that you'll be working with during its 1.5 stints in each sign.) Translation: This was an instant attraction. They knew they had the feels for each other and their first meeting set the course for the rest of their relationship.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2003, when Kim and Kanye met, Jupiter was in Leo. But Jupiter was in the opposite sign of Aquarius, an often frustrating time — although not emotionally devastating — when a judge declared Kim legally single.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-nodal-energy></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Nodal Energy</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In May 2020, Kimye started to have a Nodal Return to their first meeting back in 2003. This acts as a marker at the beginning and end of their relationship (with the North Node in Gemini and the South Node in Sagittarius). This transit in the same signs occurs every 18 years.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And, in 2012, when they made their relationship official, that was the halfway mark of their relationship. This means that they were having their Nodal Opposition (the North Node was in Sagittarius and the South Node was in Gemini). This energy aspected Kim's seventh house of partnerships, squared her Venus (planet of love), and her Moon (planet of comforts and security). So, there was major activation around love and relationships.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For Kanye, it connects with his Sun and Jupiter in Gemini, making their relationship feel abundant and prosperous. Also, this energy squares his Moon in Pisces, which means that like Kim, there is action being taken around their domestic life. This all adds up since, in late 2012, the couple announced they were expecting their first baby.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2014, when Kimye got married, the Nodes of Destiny were in Libra and Aries. They were aligned with Kim's Libra Sun and Kanye was having his Nodal Return. Again, we see another nodal connection. In the composure chart (when looking at a composite chart in astrology, the most important focus is the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>ascendant</a> because this shows how two people relate to each other and the world as a couple), their joint ascendant is in Libra. Being that the composite ascendant is the midpoint of their two charts, combined as one, it means that their union was meant to be.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2020, the Nodes of Destiny were in Cancer and Capricorn, which means that there was a nodal square to these points that added stresses to their partnership — which we all saw play out in headlines that the pair were "leading separate lives" and struggling with Kanye's very public mental health struggles.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-saturnian-energy></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Saturnian Energy</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now, let's talk about Saturnian energy a.k.a. Kanye's cosmic wake-up call. In an astrological sense, Kanye embarked on his Saturn opposition, which squares the degrees Saturn was transiting when they got married in 2014. This created a T-Square between his natal Saturn in Leo, transiting Saturn in Aquarius, and Saturn in Scorpio (Saturn was in Scorpio when they got married). A T-Square is fraught energy that creates a planetary opposition and two planetary squares. It's a time of action and change of plans. Being that this occurred with the commitment planet Saturn, it dictated the slow end of their marriage. However, it (along with their four kids together) also keeps them in each other's lives (Perhaps that's why <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Kim attended Kanye's listening party</a>?). Saturn is the glue that holds people's charts together.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme8Csq6unnKS0unnPq5ydoZOpsqV5yqKkZqORo8amecOiraiqk5o%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./hallie-gnatovich-wiki-age-married-life-josh-gates-baby-net-worth-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hallie Gnatovich Wiki: Age, Married Life with Josh Gates, Baby, Net Worth">&larr;
