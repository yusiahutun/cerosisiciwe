But for now, he’s happy to sail around the world; especially on Parsifal III featured on </span><i><span>Below Deck Sailing Yacht</span></i><span> season 4.</span></p><p><span>Learn more about this dreamer as this Chase Lemacks Bio proceeds.</span></p><h3><b>Chase Lemacks On Below Deck Sailing Yacht Season 4</b></h3><p><span>Bravo revealed that </span><i><span>Below Deck Sailing Yacht</span></i><span> season 4 could be their wildest charter season yet. And on it was Chase Lemacks turning on “the charm for the demanding guests.” The crew this season was led by Captain Glenn Shephard as they set sail on Parsifal III around Sardinia, Italy.</span></p><p><span>According to Bravo, “Chase knows how to turn on the charm for the demanding guests this season. Chase originally joined the world of yachting with the dream of one day sailing around the world running charters on a sailboat of his own. Having solely worked on large motor yachts since 2019, it was an exciting challenge and welcome change of pace to come on board a sailing vessel.”</span></p><p><span>But Chase was just one of the new faces who boarded Parsifal III for the charter season. Joining him on this adventure also were newbies <a href=#>Chef Ileisha Dell</a>, stews Lucy Edmunds and Mads Herrera, and deckhand Alex Propson. Also, the returning stars, Daisy Kelliher, Gary King, and Colin MacRae, were there to guide them.</span></p><p><span>“Here we freaking go y’all!!! #BelowDeckSailing Season 4 premiers Monday, April 10th on @bravotv @belowdeckbravo I’m so happy I can finally share this with everyone! One of the craziest experiences of my life and it’s gonna be one heck of a ride! Set your calendars, trust me, you won’t want to miss this,” Chase promoted the show on his IG.</span></p><h3><b>How Much Is Chase Lemacks Net Worth?</b></h3><p><span>Chase Lemacks garnered a net worth of above $300 thousand by 2023. Guess, he’s on his way to buying that dream sailboat. But for now, he still works as a deckhand on smaller boats. His last venture was with Parsifal III. Reportedly, he made around $3,500-$4,500 a month while working there.</span></p><p><span>So far, he’s had over 4 years of experience in the yachting industry. His expertise includes yacht handling, maintenance, and management. Also, he’s commended for his hard work ethic, attention to detail, and ability to work well under pressure. Overall, he’s a reliable team player and a quick learner.</span></p><p><span>Glad to have found his calling in the yacht industry, Chase said, “After graduating college I’ve accomplished everything I wanted and all of my prayers have been answered. I still believe I have the best job in the world and I know I’m doing exactly what I’m meant to be doing.”</span></p><p><span>As for his education, Chase graduated from </span><i><span>Charleston Southern University</span></i><span> in 2019.</span></p><p><span>At </span><i><span>Charleston</span></i><span>, Chase was named Mr. CSU 2017 and his team took second place in CSU’s small business competition in April 2016.</span></p><p><span>When Chase’s not working, he loves to get his hands dirty — backpacking, hunting, and fixing up old homes.</span></p><h3><b>Chase Lemacks Age</b></h3><p><span>Chase Lemacks was reportedly born in 1997. That made him 25 years of age when he appeared on </span><i><span>Below Deck Sailing Yacht</span></i><span> in 2023.</span></p><p><span>He was one of the younger cast that season.</span></p><h3><b>Chase Lemacks Family</b></h3><p><span>Chase Lemacks comes from a family of four.</span></p><p><span>His father, William (Bill) Lemacks is a Foreman and the owner of </span><i><span>Lemacks Custom Construction</span></i><span>. He turned 60 on July 25, 2022. On his 54th birthday, Chase took to his IG to feature his dad over a post captioned, “Made some corn-hole boards for Dad’s birthday…just so I could show him up. Thanks @davnic0414 for the help!”</span></p><p><span>As for his mother, Linda Lee Johnson turned 59 in August 1963. She is a&nbsp; Summerville, South Carolina native who worked at her alma mater </span><i><span>Charleston Southern University</span></i><span>. “Hoping you’re all having a great Mother’s Day! Here’s to the woman who puts up with me and my brother’s continuous nonsense,” Chase wished her on Mother’s Day 2018.</span></p><p><span>Likewise, Linda is a proud mother. Back when Chase was working with homeless people and testifying about his faith in 2012, Linda said that “It’s a side of my crazy, hyper, son that few people get to see.”</span></p><p><span>Sadly, Chase’s parents have long separated. Now, Linda’s remarried.</span></p><p><span>Talking about his sibling, Chase has a 4-year-older brother named Dalton Lemacks who worked at </span><i><span>South Carolina Stingrays</span></i><span>. In 2022, he lived in Charleston, South Carolina with his fiancee Anna Stahl @</span><a href=#><span>scstahl88</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Overall, family is the most important thing to Chase. Even though he feels successful and content with his job, there are days when Chase really wishes he was home with the people he loves. “All material things in this life will fade. Family and love are the only riches that last forever,” he once said.</span></p><h3><b>Is Chase Lemacks Dating Anyone?</b></h3><p><span>No, before joining </span><i><span>Below Deck Sailing Yacht</span></i><span>, Chase Lemacks wasn’t dating anyone.</span></p><p><span>So, this meant he was open to the boatmances that are popular on </span><i><span>Below Deck</span></i><span>.</span></p><h3><b>Chase Lemacks Height</b></h3><p><span>Chase Lemacks stands tall at a height of under 6 feet 1 inch (185 cm).</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li><h4><b>Where Is Chase Lemacks From?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Chase hails from Charleston, South Carolina.
