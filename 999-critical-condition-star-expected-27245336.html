So to my understanding, I was bending a piece of work, or possibly even taking a little bit of a bend out of a piece of work.

I think I was knocked out and then went to hospital.</p><p>"We’ve since seen the footage of what is going out tonight and I was sort of awake but you wouldn’t have got any sense out of me.</p><p>"Apparently they asked me at the time if they could ring my wife and I had said ‘no, it’s alright don’t worry about it’"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article27244672.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/0_tashmain1.jpg><p>The first time dad, who had a five month old daughter at the time of the tragic accident revealed that it took weeks for him to regain any form of memory.</p><p>He said: "My accident happened on 2nd December 2021 and I can’t remember much from then until Christmas day - probably because Christmas is a significant day.</p><p>"But I actually can’t remember a thing until around 17 or 18 December.</p><p>"I remember my wife coming to the hospital which to be honest I thought she’d only been a couple of times, but she was like 'no, I was there everyday.

The scalp where they obviously had to do brain surgery, they took the top of the scalp off and I think that’s held together by eight plates.</p><p>"My nose has been rebuilt and I think there’s a couple of plates on the right hand side of my forehead. I can't remember for sure but I think somebody said I had around 19 plates in total, but I could be mistaken."</p><p>Commending surgeon's who had worked tirelessly on his face, he commented: "I can’t get over the job they’ve done, it’s not my original face, it’s not but it’s not too bad, it’s alright.</p><span class=factbox-header><h3>Like what you see?
