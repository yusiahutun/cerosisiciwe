After binge-watching all 12&nbsp;episodes, we were keen to know more about leading actress Daisy and what she's like in real life.

She also held supporting roles in the serialised <strong>War of the Worlds</strong>, and she also starred as Olivia Marsden in the <strong>Cold Feet </strong>reboot. She also had a recurring role as Delia Rawson in 2019's BBC series <strong>Gentleman Jack</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4baf4024cbad-daisy-edgar-jones-cold-feet-z.jpg><p id=egHfYCukuCfi data-wc=7><strong>Daisy on the set of Cold Feet</strong></p><h2 dir=ltr>Is Daisy Edgar-Jones Irish?</h2><p id=evp_isrtzyxm data-wc=70>No! She's not. She was born in London and grew up in Muswell Hill. And yes, we were surprised, too! In a recent interview with InStyle, she said: "I had a brilliant accent coach who helped. Also, Lenny [the director] had a very, very specific idea of her voice, because Ireland is amazing — there are so many different accents, and it was really important to get the nuance right."</p><p id=eN10GCndRwIM data-wc=53>She continued: "I think when you're a young person, you start to speak like your peers. But obviously, Marianne doesn't have very many friends at school, so it's kind of good that she has a slightly more upper-class, sort of posh way of speaking that's maybe a little bit alienating for her peers."</p><p id=eQxnE3EWECkq data-wc=70>Daisy's&nbsp;mum helped!&nbsp;Speaking at a BAFTA Q&A, she explained: "The accent was really important to me as well. I am lucky that my mum is from the north of Ireland so that helped. It is kind of like singing and I have been over to Ireland loads of time as a child so I had an understanding of the 'r' sound and the specifics of the accent and sensibilities."&nbsp;</p><p id=evtjA-9YDq76 data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>30 TV shows to get excited about in 2020</a></strong></p><strong class=fr-embedded><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1edf735b5892-daisy-edgar-jones-laughing-z.jpg></strong> <strong></strong><p id=eguhgsNWh3VA data-wc=12><strong>Daisy Edgar-Jones and Paul Mescal&nbsp;during a press call for Normal People</strong></p><h2 dir=ltr>Where does Daisy Edgar-Jones live?</h2><p id=eWEJwvEtZiyf data-wc=28>She lives in a London flatshare with three other people.

I really love Lorna [Marie Mugan], who was the costume designer, because I couldn't really picture how Marianne would dress, particularly in Sligo, in the earlier [episodes]. There isn't much description of costume other than like heavy, clunky shoes, and a corduroy skirt. I think when she was in her more confident era, outfit-wise, it was so fun. I particularly liked the outfit where they reunite for the first time in Trinity. You can't really see it in the scene, but I have these pantaloons on, these kind of silk culottes with this vintage sort of jacket. The costumes were so fun to wear."</p><p id=eUi_9eVfHR67 data-wc=1><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Loved Marianne's Normal People outfits?

When asked if she'd ever have an edgy short fringe, she said: "I'm not edgy enough at all. You have to be edgy and cool, and I'm just not. So I think I'm going to stick with the bangs that mostly cover your whole face. Those are the kind I like the most. Though they're very hard to maintain in isolation.

It was a terrifying day because you've been cast, but a massive part of your brain is like 'oh god, what if they realise they made a mistake?!' Sally came over and she was so lovely and she seemed really excited and kind of overwhelmed as well because it must have been crazy for her."&nbsp;</p><p id=eycMKOGbnNtSr data-wc=39>She added: "She gave us the freedom to interpret it the way we did and she's amazing ... she came to set a few times but on the whole, she was in New York working on her next novel."</p><h2 dir=ltr>Did Daisy Edgar-Jones and Paul Mescal get on?&nbsp;</h2><p id=e71Cfx3fMk8SK data-wc=68>She told Elizabeth Day: "Paul and I's relationship is the polar opposite of Marianne and Connell's.
