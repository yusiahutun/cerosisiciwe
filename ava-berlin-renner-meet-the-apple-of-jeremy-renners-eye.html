However, the famous man is never too busy to spend time with his lovely daughter, Ava Berlin Renner.&nbsp;As things stand, Ava is currently the “most important person” in actor Jeremy’s life. She is his weakness, and he doesn’t mind everybody knowing.&nbsp;</p><p>The talented actor welcomed Ava, 10, with his former wife, Sonni Pacheco, in March 2013. He was 42 when it happened — a mature age, to be sure, but Jeremy believes becoming a dad later in life is “the best thing” he’s ever done.</p><p>According to him, by the time Ava, his first and only child so far, came along, he had achieved many things, and now he gets to spend time with his family. After his daughter was born, Jeremy was forced to change his demanding filming schedule.&nbsp;</p><p>As far as he was concerned, his “perspective on things” had changed. He said: “The only thing I think about when I’m not with my baby is, How do I get to my baby? I’m very miserable when I don’t see her. I really love being a father.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/fathrrer.jpg><p>Jeremy has claimed Ava Berlin Renner inspires him to be the best version of himself, but enough about the doting father’s love for his daughter. What do we really know about her?&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=When_Was_Ava_Berlin_Renner_Born></span>When Was Ava Berlin Renner Born?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jeremy Renner’s daughter was born on March 28, 2013, and weighed seven pounds. The actor’s spokesperson revealed at the time that her parents were beyond joyful and were very excited.&nbsp;</p><p>The proud father shared more details about Ava’s birth while celebrating her 9th birthday on Instagram in 2022. He wrote about the first time he met his child: “As you took your FIRST breath, gripping my finger tightly (palmers reflex), I instantly understood my directive in life as a father. If I do right by you, we will hold hands as I take my LAST breath.”</p><p>Jeremy tied the knot with Pacheco several months after they welcomed Ava. However, it was not meant to last. The actor filed for divorce ten months later in December 2014, citing “irreconcilable differences,” they now share custody of their daughter.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Does_Ava_Berlin_Renner_Have_Healing_Abilities></span>Does Ava Berlin Renner Have Healing Abilities?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>On the day 2023 started, many people spent the day having fun, but not Jeremy Renner. He was in “critical but stable condition” after a snow plow, which reportedly weighs at least 14,330 lbs, ran him over on the auspicious day.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/fatherr.jpg><p>The “Avengers” actor reportedly broke over 30 bones and required multiple surgeries and months of physical therapy. It was believed he would need a long time to recuperate, but mere months after the incident, Jeremy was up and about again.&nbsp;</p><p>He credited Ava with helping him get back on his feet quickly. He <a href=#>said</a>: “My daughter, for sure, number one. And then my family, and then my will. It’s like, well, if I was going to go, I guess, it’s one or the other. There’s no alternative to like, ‘Alright, I’m going to be living, so let’s go really live and get it done.’ So there’s no alternative. I have to kind of do something.”&nbsp;</p><p>While wishing her a happy 10th birthday, Jeremy thanked his daughter: “Your hugs and your love have healed me so incredibly fast.”&nbsp;</p><p>Jeremy’s doctor, Dr. Christopher Vincent, also said Ava was “one of his strongest motivators” to get up and moving again. He <a href=#>said</a>: “You really reflect on life when something like this happens. It’s like, ‘Okay, what’s important?'”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Ava_Berlin_Renner_Has_Passion_for_the_Arts></span>Ava Berlin Renner Has Passion for the Arts<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ava has been described as an artistic child by many. This made her father’s fans wonder if she would someday join the movie industry.&nbsp;</p><p>Jeremy shared how he feels about her getting into showbiz in 2016. According to him, he doesn’t know whether Ava will end up as an actor like him, but left to him, she would steer clear of the career.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/jerrner-fotor-20230830141144-688x1024.jpg><p>He said: “I’ll never say no.” But he would prefer she chose a different path. Regardless of her decision, the “Hawkeye” star knows his daughter is “definitely artistic, for sure.”</p><p>Jeremy is more focused on her having a fun-filled and happy life, a standard sentiment popular among girl dads like the actor. Other girl dads like him include Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, Tim McGraw, and <a href=#>Ryan Gosling</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51krretjJucq6SZo3qzsc2nnKtlnZqytXnToZxmmaCluaZ5zp9ko52imrq6edGepaedoqh6psXEaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./emmanuel-hudson-gay-emmanuel-hudson-gay-dating-affair-girlfriend-wiki-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Emmanuel Hudson Gay?
