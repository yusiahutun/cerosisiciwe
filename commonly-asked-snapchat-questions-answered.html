The temporary nature of these "snaps" has been the big selling point for the app.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Snapchat has some really cool features beyond that, the ease of use when it comes to finding these features is kind of tricky. A lot of the time, Snapchat leaves people scratching their heads, and asking "how do I use it?"</p><p>Today, we're going to make things easier by rounding up some simple answers to Snapchat's most commonly asked questions.</p><h2 id=how-do-i-make-a-voice-or-video-call-on-snapchat>How Do I Make a Voice or Video Call on Snapchat?</h2><p>We have a separate article explaining <a href=#>how to make video and voice calls on Snapchat</a>.</p><p>In a nutshell, as long as you and your friend(s) have access to data or Wi-Fi, you'll be able to chat through voice or video just like you would with any other conferencing interface. Just press the "phone" or "video" buttons in the top right-hand corner of your screen, and you're ready to go.</p><p>To learn more about voice and video calls, you can also check out <a href=#>Snapchat's help page</a> on the subject.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=your-questions-about-snapchat-stories-answered>Your Questions About Snapchat Stories, Answered</h2><p>While we can't answer every question you may have about Snapchat Stories here, we'll definitely tackle the most confusing.</p><h3 id=why-does-snapchat-keep-switching-between-friends-when-i-m-watching-stories>1. Why Does Snapchat Keep Switching Between Friends When I'm Watching Stories?</h3><p>One Snapchat update feature that caused users the most confusion when it first came out was the "auto-advance" option that kicked in while watching stories.</p><p>Although this feature has seen many subsequent improvements, it's worthwhile to explain the basics:</p><ul><li>When you're watching a story, Snapchat moves you to the next story on your list once you're finished watching (instead of returning to the homepage).</li><li>If you want to skip a story, just swipe across your screen with your thumb.</li><li>If you want to stop the autoplay, just pull down on your screen with your thumb. You'll be returned to the main menu.</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=what-are-campus-stories-on-snapchat>2. What Are Campus Stories on Snapchat?</h3><p>Campus Stories are a type of Snapchat Story. They have been curated for select college campuses, and you will only be able to see them if:</p><ul><li>You turn on your location services for the app.</li><li>You are currently on a college campus.</li><li>Or, you have been on a college campus within the last 24 hours.</li></ul><p>If you're using this feature, remember to protect your privacy, just as you would for any other public story. Snapchat has gotten some bad press for its "security risks." Unfortunately, a few of those concerns are well-founded, as reported by <a href=#>Forbes</a> in 2019.</p><p>When using Campus Stories:</p><ul><li>Avoid using full names.</li><li>Avoid showing people where you live.</li><li>Don't display anything you wouldn't want to be used in a screenshot.</li><li>Understand that there are privacy risks involved.</li></ul><p>It's better to be safe than sorry.</p><h3 id=how-do-i-reply-to-a-snapchat-story>3.
