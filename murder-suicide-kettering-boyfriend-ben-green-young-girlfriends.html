They would be young, aged between 22 and 30. He had at least three girlfriends. They would last about six months and then another one would appear."</p><p>She said he was "very difficult" to get to know and dubbed him "arrogant".</p><p>She added: "Sometimes I would say hi and he wouldn’t even respond.</p><p>"He would say hi to my husband, but not to me. He would look at me as if to say 'why are you talking to me?'</p><p>"It’s shocking to find out what happened. It made me feel very sick."</p><p>They had everything going for them and everything to live for. I cannot believe he has killed Maddie and then taken his own life.</p><span class=quote-credit>Friend of the couple</span><p>Another neighbour confirmed seeing young women visit the marketing director at his former home - a new-build semi-detached.</p><p>Adam Rodwell, 30, from Kettering, said: "They were both fairly young, in their early twenties."</p><p>He added: "He wouldn’t say anything unless you approached him first. He was arrogant. It was just his demeanour."</p><p>Green's pals described him as a "fabulous dad" and said he and Maddie had been together for about two years.</p><p>One told The Sun: "Ben was a great friend… his kid I last saw at Easter and gave them Easter eggs.</p><p>"I feel for the children who he loved some much and he religiously went to see them ever other weekend and brought them back for the weekend to spend quality time with them.</p><p>"He was a fabulous dad and he will be sadly missed by his children."</p><h2>'VERY DISTRESSING'</h2><p>Another distraught friend of the couple told of his pain over the deaths, spending 20 minutes discussing what had happened with police at the scene.</p><p>He said: "Ben and Maddie had been together for about two years and were really happy. They’d recently been abroad on holiday and he has just been promoted at work.</p><p>"They had everything going for them and everything to live for. I cannot believe he has killed Maddie and then taken his own life.</p><p>"He doesn’t have it in his bones to do that. I don’t know what’s happened, I don’t know what’s gone wrong but it’s very distressing. Ben’s a good guy."</p><p>The pal said the couple were happy together and Maddie lived between his house and her own place.</p><p>"It’s very upsetting. Police won’t tell me anything but just said the incident is contained and they’re not looking for any one else in connection," he said.</p><p>"I knew Ben through work circles and spoke to him only recently.</p><p>"I knew Maddie too. They were a striking looking couple and turned heads when they were out together."</p><p>Our hearts are broken and we cannot begin to imagine life without her. The shock and pain we are feeling is indescribable.</p><span class=quote-credit>Maddie's family</span><p>In a message on Facebook, Maddie's devastated mum Rachel, 46, paid tribute to her daughter.</p><p>She wrote: "These are the hardest words we have ever had to write.</p><p>"Our beautiful beautiful Maddie is gone. She has grown her own set of wings and gone to fly with the angels.</p><p>"22 years of loving this amazing girl will never be enough, we thought we had a lifetime ahead of us.</p><p>"Please hold your loved ones a little tighter and kiss them a little longer... you never know when it may be your last opportunity.</p><p>"Baby girl… you were our world and our lives are not complete without you in it. Heaven is so lucky to have you."</p><p>A family statement issued by police on behalf of Maddie's family said: ''We are absolutely devastated at the loss of Maddie, our beautiful daughter, sister, granddaughter and niece.</p><p>''Our hearts are broken and we cannot begin to imagine life without her. The shock and pain we are feeling is indescribable.</p><p>''She was a beautiful person both inside and out, who loved nothing more than spending time with her family and friends.</p><p>''Maddie was a kind, caring, thoughtful young woman, who touched the lives of everyone she met.</p><p>"A talented dancer, her creative talent continued through school and into her career in marketing.</p><p>"Her life has been sadly cut short just as her career was blossoming.</p><p>''Our thoughts are with everybody who knew and loved Maddie as much as we did.''</p><p>Maddie's friends took to social media to pay a heartfelt tribute to their pal.</p><h2>'TRAGICALLY TAKEN FROM US'</h2><p>One said: "We never thought in a million years that we would be writing this.</p><p>"Our beautiful best friend was tragically taken from us and is now an angel in heaven.</p><p>"We spoke just before you left this world and our last words were ‘love you’.</p><p>"We are so lucky to of had a friend like you and knowing you will always be with us gives us so much comfort.</p><p>"We don’t know how to do life without you, we are so broken. You will always be in our hearts Madds and we promise to do right by you."</p><p>Detective Inspector Nicole Main <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">said on Monday</a>: "While we await a formal identification of Benjamin, we have taken the step of naming him today with the support of his family.</p><p>"We understand he and Maddie had been in a relationship, and are working to establish as much as is possible about the circumstances in which they died.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>"This is an incredibly sad case, and we ask that the grief and privacy of both families are respected by the media as they mourn their loved ones.</p><p>"They are overwhelmed with sadness and have asked that they be left in peace at this terribly distressing time."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NINTCHDBPICT000676230394.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/82769101-1cfa-40c5-b023-8cffb042d3bc.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/84a49a3a-c67d-4002-afdb-2a2921ba2858.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/6930199a-6064-462a-8b9c-2bae2e976fe8.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NINTCHDBPICT000675717044.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NINTCHDBPICT000675717013.jpg><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">How you can get help</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Women's Aid has this advice for victims and their families:</p><ul><li>Always keep your phone nearby.</li><li>Get in touch with charities for help, including the Women’s Aid live chat helpline and services such as SupportLine.</li><li>If you are in danger, call 999.</li><li>Familiarise yourself with the Silent Solution,&nbsp;where you call 999 and press ‘55’ if you can’t safely speak.</li><li>Always keep some money&nbsp;or a bank card&nbsp;on you, including change&nbsp;in case you need a pay phone or bus fare.</li><li>If you suspect your partner is about to attack you, try to&nbsp;move towards an exit if you are inside the house and get your phone in case you need to call for help.</li><li>Avoid the kitchen and garage, where there are likely to be knives or other&nbsp;potential&nbsp;weapons.
