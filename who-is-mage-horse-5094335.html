This reduced field comes after Forte, the 3-1 favorite to win, became the fifth horse to ‚Äòscratch‚Äô ‚Äì aka to be withdrawn ‚Äì from the race. Churchill Downs said Forte co-owner Mike Repole attributed the scratch to state veterinarians‚Äô worries over a bruised right foot, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Washington Post</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/kentucky-derby-mage-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-18>Practical Move withdrew due to an elevated temperature. Continuar was pulled for lack of fitness. Skinner pulled out due to an elevated temperature, and Lord Miles was pulled in part to trainer <strong>Saffie Joseph Jr. </strong>being indefinitely suspended ‚Äì more on that in a bit. These scratches allowed Cyclone Mischief, Mandarin Hero, and King Russell to compete in the Kentucky Derby, but the field was still reduced to 18 horses. Overall, it‚Äôs the most scratches in a Kentucky Derby since 1936.</p><p id=content-paragraph-19>It‚Äôs believed that the Derby with the most scratches is 1933‚Äôs.

CDI had ‚Äúreasonable concerns about the condition of his horses,‚Äù and suspended him ‚Äúuntil details are analyzed and understood.‚Äù</p><p id=content-paragraph-22>Parents Pride and Chasing Artie, unfortunately, weren‚Äôt the only horses who died in the lead-up to the Kentucky Derby. There were six confirmed deaths going into the race. Wild On Ice, another Kentucky Derby contender, was hurt while training on Apr. 27. Take Charge Briana was injured during a race on May 2. Both were ‚Äúeuthanized for humane reasons,‚Äù claimed Churchill Downs.</p><p id=content-paragraph-23>Chloe‚Äôs Dream was injured during an undercard race on Saturday. ‚ÄúHe just took a bad step out there,‚Äù trainer Jeff Hiles said to the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Associated Press</a>. ‚ÄúThey could do the same thing running in the field as they could on the track. So it‚Äôs very unfortunate. That‚Äôs what we deal with.‚Äù</p><p id=content-paragraph-24>Racehorse Freezing Point was also injured during their undercard race and was euthanized. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt make me happy to see a horse get euthanized,‚Äù said racegoer Joe Conforto, per AP. ‚ÄúBut I think a lot of it is bad luck. Most racehorses are taken better care of than human beings.‚Äù</p><p id=content-paragraph-25>The deaths and suspension come just weeks before the governing body of horse racing is about to enact new anti-doping and medication rules. Infamously, Medina Spirit crossed the finish line first at the 2021 Kentucky Derby but was stripped of the win after failing a post-race drug test. Medina Spirit died later that year after a workout at a track in Southern California, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>NPR</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2K6orPEZp%2BoqqOaenZ8mG1qbG1f</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./frankie-bridge-rainbow-leopard-print-dress-camel-coat-instagram-karen-millen.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Frankie Bridge's gorgeous rainbow leopard print dress is perfect for cocktail hour">&larr;
