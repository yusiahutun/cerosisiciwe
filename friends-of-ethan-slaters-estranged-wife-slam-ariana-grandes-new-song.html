He and his estranged wife Lilly Jay had only recently welcomed a son when they split after 10 years together. The couple were high school sweethearts and tied the knot in 2018. Meanwhile, Ariana split from her ex-husband Dalton Gomez last year after they married in 2021. Lilly’s friends have now called out Ariana’s latest single and accused the <a href=#>music</a> star of “lacking empathy.”</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1202200922-1024x682.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ariana-grande-s-new-song-disrespectful-says-friend-of-ethan-slater-s-wife>Ariana Grande’s new song ‘disrespectful’ says friend of Ethan Slater’s wife</h2><p>The new song was released yesterday (January 12) and was her first release in three years. It seems to address the rumors swirling foveror the past year about the <a href=#>celebrity’s</a> personal life.</p><p>She sings lyrics such as “Yes, and?” / Say that s*** with your chest” and “Your business is yours and mine is mine / Why do you care so much whose d*** I ride? / Why?”</p><p>The source <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> MailOnline: “For her to take the opportunity in her first song since all of this went down to show a complete lack of remorse for her actions is utterly disrespectful.</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Jason Momoa split from his wife on wedding anniversary – years before telling fans</a></p><p>“Yes, Ariana has destroyed a home and she does not seem to care.”</p><p>They continued by blasting Ariana for not creating music that is healing for herself and her fans, affectionately known as Arianators.</p><p>“She created art that basically says, “f*** you I don’t care what I did to hurt anyone because I am happy.”‘</p><p>However, another source close to the 34+35 singer defended her by saying Yes, And doesn’t “address anyone specific.”</p><p>“If you watch the video, the people she’s performing to are literally played by critics. The lyrics and the video are really quite clear,” they said. “It is a song about not judging each other or a situation by hearsay and about how you never know what people are going through or healing from.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ariana-seemingly-speaks-out>Ariana seemingly speaks out</h2><p>Welcoming in 2024, the 30-year-old shared her dwellings of the last year with fans on her <a href=#>Instagram</a> Stories. In the lengthy post, she called 2023 “challenging” and said she felt “deeply misunderstood.”</p><p>“One of the most transformative, most challenging, and yet happiest and most special years of my life. There were so many beautiful and yet polarized feelings. I’ve never felt more at the mercy of and in acceptance of what life was screaming to teach me. I’ve never felt more fulfilled by or present in my work, being able to cherish every moment,” she penned.</p><p>“I have everything I could have possibly given of my heart and of myself to the projects I was fortunate enough to be a part of and learned so much from every brilliant, beautiful, soul that I had the privilege of creating art with and crossing paths with… I have never felt more pride or joy or love while simultaneously feeling so deeply misunderstood by people who don’t know me, who piece whispers together and make what they want out of me and their assumptions of my life.”</p><p>Ariana Grande continued by stating she felt “fiercely protected” by her loved ones after the speculation about Ethan Slater and his estranged wife.</p><p>“I feel safe, even amidst so many things I’d usually be afraid of. I am listening to and trusting myself, even when fear or trauma tells me not to,” said Grande. “I am reacting to things that deserve my energy and removing and protecting myself from things that do not,” she said.</p><p>“I am so eternally grateful for all of the feelings I was lucky enough to feel so deeply this year. Mine and Galinda’s alike. The unfathomably hard ones and the inexplicably happy ones. I feel more human than ever. I feel more deeply than ever. I feel softer and stronger, all at once.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Hollywood</a> star concluded: “If you ever feel misunderstood or alone, just remember that it will pass and you are not. Take a deep breath and know that you are so incredibly loved.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-lilly-jay-speaks-out>Lilly Jay speaks out</h2><p>After the news broke of <a href=#>Ariana Grande and Ethan Slater’s romance</a> his estranged wife spoke to Page Six about the situation. She called her family “collateral damage.”</p><p>She <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>: “[Ariana’s] the story, really. Not a girl’s girl,” Jay exclusively tells Page Six. “My family is just collateral damage.”</p><p>She added she was focused on raising their child and being a “good mom.”</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Bruno Mars and his girlfriend face trouble after ‘living separate lives’</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2aAcLLRopynnKNivKd5xK2fmqZdqLmiwMSrqmado6m%2ForrGnptmr5mbsm6%2Fy5qkZpminq6vrYygqZqmlJrAbrrEsGSsp56cfA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./daniella-rahme.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Daniella Rahme dating?
