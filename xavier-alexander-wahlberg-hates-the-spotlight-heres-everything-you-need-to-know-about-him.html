However, some reports claim she is a sound engineer who got into her craft at 22. Fey met Donnie in 1991, but they did not get married until August 20, 1999. The marriage lasted for nine years before they decided to separate.&nbsp;</p><p>While she was with Donnie, they welcomed two kids, including Xavier Alexander Wahlberg. After their divorce, Fey took custody of both kids, but Donnie played an active role in their lives.&nbsp;</p><p>Xavier Alexander Wahlberg is Donnie Wahlberg’s first son. Donnie and Fey welcomed him on March 4, 1993.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Donnie-and-Kim-676x1024.jpg><p>At the time, Donnie was just a 23-year-old, and becoming a father put the fear of God in his youthful rebellious heart. He once claimed that being a father changed his life positively.&nbsp;</p><p>Before Xavier came along, Donnie was often involved in altercations with the law. He indulged in tattoos, got piercings, and was reported to have a belligerent attitude that somehow always landed him in trouble.&nbsp;</p><p>At some point, he was even charged with arson after he set the hall of a Kentucky hotel on fire. Donnie would later confess that he had only been reacting to the negative side of being famous.&nbsp;</p><p>When Xavier was born, his life changed completely, and he stopped living solely for himself. He once <a href=#>said</a>:&nbsp;</p><p>“It sounds cliche, but I stopped living for me and started living for him. It stopped being about my legacy and became about my ability to provide for him. I was 23. I was terrified.”</p><p>It was the turning point in his life, and Donnie never looked back.&nbsp;</p><p>Xavier Alexander Wahlberg grew up under his father’s and mother’s guidance. He inherited their love for music, which is one of the ways he connects with Donnie.&nbsp;</p><p>Xavier has not debuted in a band as his father did. However, Donnie once <a href=#>hinted </a>that his first child is in a band, adding that he enjoys playing dark hardcore music.&nbsp;According to some reports, rather than discuss mundane topics like school, Xavier and Donnie talk about the younger man’s experiences in concerts he has attended.</p><p>Also, some sources have credited Xavier Alexander Wahlberg with acting credits. However, there is no filmography with his name at the time of this writing, and a search on IMDB for his acting credits yielded no results.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Xavier_Alexander_Wahlberg_Hates_Publicity></span>Xavier Alexander Wahlberg Hates Publicity&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Given his heritage, one would think Xavier would be used to public life. However, this is far from the truth.&nbsp;</p><p>He has only been seen publicly a handful of times. Once was when he featured alongside Donnie and his second wife, Jenny McCarthy, on the reality TV show “Donnie Loves Jenny.”&nbsp;</p><p>The show aired for three seasons and explored Donnie and his second wife’s life and their wedding. Fans loved the show. However, Donnie later <a href=#>admitted</a> that neither Xavier nor his stepbrother Evan was comfortable with it.&nbsp;</p><p>Donnie was also the one who revealed that Xavier dislikes publicity. He said Xavier would get mad at him for mentioning his name on live TV. Xavier has very little social media presence, so not much is known about his personal life.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Donnies_Blended_Family></span>Donnie’s Blended Family<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After Donnie’s marriage to Fey ended, he married Jenny McCarthy in 2014. He took on stepfather responsibilities for her son Evan, and she became stepmom to his sons Xavier Alexander Wahlberg and Elijah.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/jenny-mccarthy-hair-donnie-wahlberg-1.jpg><p>McCarthy had <a href=#>Evan</a> with her former husband, John Asher. She and Donnie share a strong bond with the children, who love them just as fiercely.&nbsp;</p><p>Donnie has praised McCarthy for being the best partner a man could ask for and a fantastic stepmom to his sons. The actor claims she is an amazing wife and has also expressed gratitude for finding someone he could build traditions with.&nbsp;</p><p>Like many other <a href=#>celebrities who dote over their kids</a>, Donnie always prioritizes his children and is very proud of them. The boys are older now, and fans are counting the days until Donnie and his wife become grandparents.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kxaLCyJ6pZpmcmsWiusOeqWavkZ25o7HRoGShmaSawG7Ax55krKifqbmqs8etZKGdoprAbrHVnqmyrJieu6h52KisZqaVmrFuwM5moqenp2Kuo7vUrWShoZ1k</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./conor-mcgregor-challenges-mike-perry-fight-bkfc-luke-rockhold.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="                              Conor McGregor Faces Off with Mike Perry at Bare Knuckle Fighting Cha">&larr;
