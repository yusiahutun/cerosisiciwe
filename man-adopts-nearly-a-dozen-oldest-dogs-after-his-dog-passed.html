Several months after Wolfgang passed in 2012, Greig still couldn’t accept the loss. He felt helpless.</p><p>“I wasn’t functioning that well,” said 59-year-old Greig. “I decided to go to the shelter and adopt a dog they would probably put down.” According to reports, many often overlook older dogs at shelters.</p><p>Prospective adopters see them as less desirable, and they typically euthanize them first if they aren’t adopted quickly. “In a way,” Greig figured, adopting a senior animal, “would give Wolfgang’s death purpose.” “He died, but another dog got to live because of that,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>Consequently, Greig adopted the oldest dog at the shelter, a chihuahua, Eeyore, who had knee problems and a heart murmur. Afterward, Greig, who lives alone, aside from his pets, said he started healing immediately. “I could tell it was exactly what I needed to do.”</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>The Incredible Story of Diamond, a Death Row Dog, Adopted at the Nick of Time</a></strong></p><p>Greig and Eoyore had six years together, and Eeyore lived to be 19. Within three months of taking Eeyore home, Greig adopted another senior dog. However, he kept taking in more. “It just kind of went from there,” he said.</p><p>For over a decade, Greig’s home in Denver became a shelter for senior canines. The 59-year-old has about nine old dogs living with him but has 11. “When one passes, I normally adopt another in their honor,” said Greig. Over the years, Greig has adopted dozens of disabled and elderly dogs.</p><p>The 59-year-old hopes to give them the happiest end-of-life experience possible. In addition, he sleeps with at least seven dogs in his queen-size bed. Sometimes, more pups squeeze in. “Being in bed with all those warm dogs, it’s just the best thing in the world,” said Greig.</p><p><a href=#><strong>POLL — Is Climate Change a Major Threat That Requires Immediate Policy Action?</strong></a></p><p>According to Greg, his home in downtown Denver has a large backyard. His house is in an area zoned for pet exceptions, which allows him to have more than three dogs. Aside from rescuing older dogs, Greig rescued a 13-year-old pig, Bikini, four chickens, two rabbits, one duck, and a turkey.</p><p>“I’ve just stumbled upon them,” he said. According to the retired accountant, he met Bikini’s former owner at a chicken swap. He then learned that the owner wanted to get rid of the pig. Hence, Greig saved Bikini from potentially ending up at a pig farm. The senior canine lover revealed his pets get along well. “There’s kind of a pack mentality,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>Greig’s current pack includes Onion, Maytag, Mr. Magoo, Fernando, Willamena, Cat, Juanita, Chalmer, Raylene, Festus, and Loretta. Raylene, 8, is the youngest, and Loretta, 19, is the oldest.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Humanity May Conquer Breast Cancer Soon</a></strong></p><p>Many of Greig’s pooches have heart disease, incontinence, blindness, and other health issues. While some are low-maintenance and sweet, others are a little sassier and needier. However, Greig loves them all. “It’s been so great to have all these different personalities come into my life,” he said.</p><p>The retired accountant also renames most of the canines he takes in. “I once read that dogs don’t associate their names with themselves; they associate their names with you,” he said. “So, it’s not confusing for them if you rename them.”</p><p>In addition, Greig revealed he has a routine to keep track of their schedules involving medications and feeding times. “When everything is going well, and we are in a routine, it works seamlessly,” he said.</p><p>According to Greig, one of his dogs is diabetic and must eat and have insulin every 12 hours. Despite the work involved, Greig feels caring for a slew of senior dogs is less work. He added that seeing his dogs happy, even briefly, makes him happy.</p><p><strong>You Might Also Like:</strong></p><p><a href=#>Judge Dismisses Lawsuit Disputing New Minnesota Law Restoring Felons’ Voting Rights</a></p><p><a href=#>Delaware Man Pleads Guilty to Jan. 6 Felony After His Attorney Argued He Has ‘Foxmania’</a></p><p><a href=#>“Absolute Embarrassment!” Critics Lambast Liberal DC Mayor for Her Ignorance</a></p><p><a href=#>Lawyers for Atlanta Ask Federal Appeals Court to Kill ‘Stop Cop City’ Petition</a></p><p><a href=#>California Gov.
