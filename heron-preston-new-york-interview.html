A founder of the influential collective Been Trill, which included the late Virgil Abloh and Givenchy creative director Matthew Williams, Preston has staged his shows in Paris, during Men’s Fashion Week. For the first time, on Saturday evening, he’ll show in the city that nurtured the brand. “I’ve really grown as a designer,” he said, “and I started my career here in New York.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">You might even say the 39-year-old is the contemporary designer whose clothing is most about New York. In 2016, Preston collaborated with the city’s sanitation department, for which he repurposed old sanitation worker uniforms and other used clothing to highlight the organization’s efforts towards decreasing waste. Two years later, for a project with Carhartt’s fashion-forward diffusion line Carhartt WIP, he showed his pieces on art handlers, often artists themselves, who do the tricky business of carting around enormous (and enormously expensive) works of art in the brand’s heavy duty workwear.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And in 2021, he worked as a creative consultant for Calvin Klein, creating some of the brand’s best products and imagery—Kaia Gerber in jeans and high-rise briefs, Nas in cool beige sweatpants—in its post-Raf Simons period.</p><img alt="heron preston runway paris fashion week menswear fw 2020 2021" title="Heron Preston : Runway - Paris Fashion Week - Menswear F/W 2020-2021" width=2790 height=1858 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/model-walks-the-runway-during-the-heron-preston-menswear-news-photo-1676125668.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Kay-Paris Fernandes</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>A look from Preston’s most recent runway show, Fall 2021 in Paris, shown in 2020.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">So the move to New York seems like a natural fit. “I just really started missing the city,” he said. “I started missing showing and connecting with my friends and my family here in New York.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">He has a number of fans outside of the world of fashion who follow his career on Instagram; some have become his friends, and he's invited them to the show. “There’s so many different layers of fans” in fashion, he said. “You have those core fans, but then it kind of trickles out to someone who doesn’t even wear fashion or can’t even afford it. But they follow me and I work with them and they love what I post, and they always compliment me”—they particularly love the 3D-printed sneakers he first introduced in October 2021, he said. “These are people who are watching from the outside.” Many of them, he noted, have said they’ve never even been to a fashion show before.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s true that the city seems to bring something out in Preston—a wide-eyed creativity that can be harder to detect in Paris, which is a city all about fashion and less about how style, music, stores, and restaurants coalesce to create a distinctive culture. (It’s hard to imagine a Parisian designer collaborating with the city’s sanitation department.) His invitations, for example, were all discarded stuff he found wandering around New York: crushed up cans, pieces of cardboard packaging, and even remnants of a discarded sink.<br></p><img alt="heron preston uniforms for dept of sanitation event, spring summer 2017, new york fashion week, usa 07 sep 2016" title="Heron Preston uniforms for Dept. of Sanitation event, Spring Summer 2017, New York Fashion Week, USA - 07 Sep 2016" width=1024 height=682 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/atmosphere-news-photo-1676125731.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">WWD</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Clothes Preston made for his project with the New York City Sanitation Department in 2016.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As for the show, the choreography of his runway presentation will echo the pedestrian cacophony of the city, with graffiti artists (including Preston himself) spraying utility markings on the runway as the models weave in and out. He is also eager to show off the progression of his designs, which, again, are an homage to urban materials and uniform style. “This collection’s really inspired by the reclaiming of found objects and observing the city,” he said, and “looking at the city as layers of materials.” Tarp, barbed wire, and faux fur are some of his “fabrics,” along with denim; his fascination with chain link fencing inspired a swath of chainmail hoods, bras, and shirting.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s sweet to remember that a decade ago, Preston, Williams, and Abloh were just fresh-faced outsiders in New York. “We’ve always been able to identify gaps within storytelling and gaps within culture that could be filled, or done better,” he said about the enduring influence of their spirit. They were able to identify things that “hadn’t hit their full potential yet. Or maybe that thing needs to be flipped on its head. Maybe that rule needs to be rewritten. Maybe that rule needs to be erased altogether. Maybe something needs to be rebuilt from scratch, or the bottom up, instead of fixing stuff.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Their creative alliance “was always just kind of questioning culture, the vibes of the streets of youth. What do we need? What’s exciting us? What’s boring us?” He said he feels that spirit in the show he is staging Saturday evening.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">At a time when some longtime New Yorkers feel the city is changing too fast and for the worse, Preston’s show might be a reminder that the foundations remain unaltered. “Obviously, this is a fashion show. But I look at this as more of a celebration,” he said.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/eb92ba9d-3e4d-4650-b9c7-eff7aa4ac591_1647626609.PNG?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Rachel Tashjian" title="Headshot of Rachel Tashjian" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Rachel Tashjian is the Fashion News Director at Harper’s Bazaar, working across print and digital platforms.
