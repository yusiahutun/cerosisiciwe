Fires were fueled further when it was announced Ryan Gosling had bagged himself a chance to win Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Ken at the <a href=#>awards show</a>. It has caused such a ruckus on platforms such as X (formerly <a href=#>Twitter</a>) that Australian police have had their say.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-australian-police-investigating-margot-robbie-s-oscar-snub>Australian police investigating Margot Robbie’s Oscar ‘snub’</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-facebook wp-block-embed-facebook"></figure><p>Taking to Facebook, cops in Victoria, Australia, used the news to cleverly promote their service and urged citizens to report “non-urgent” crimes like theft. They even got in on the ‘This Barbie …’ meme.</p><p>The picture they shared used various photos of Margot, 33, from her different roles, including <a href=#>Barbie</a> and 2013’s Wolf of Wall Street. The meme features a hot pink speech bubble that reads: “This Barbie reports non-urgent crime online using the Motorola slide.”</p><p>“POLICE INVESTIGATE AS MARGOT ROBBIED: Police are investigating after a former resident of Ramsay Street was allegedly robbed of an Oscar nomination for best actress,” they began the post’s caption, referencing the <a href=#>movie</a> star’s three-year stint in Australian soap opera Neighbours. Margot played the character of Donna Freedman between 2008 and 2011. She made a cameo appearance in 2022 when the show broadcast its finale episode.</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>Kate Beckinsale’s heart ‘breaks all over again’ over stepdad’s death after award ‘snub’</a></p><p>They continued: “We’d like to take this opportunity to remind all current residents of Ramsay Street and the rest of Victoria, to consider reporting any non-urgent crime, such as theft, via our online reporting tool.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ryan-gosling-and-america-ferrera-speak-out>Ryan Gosling and America Ferrera speak out</h2><p>The police’s post follows the Academy being called out by Margot’s co-stars, Ryan Gosling and America Ferrera.</p><p>In his statement, Ryan <a href=#>called out Margot Robbie’s Oscar snub</a> despite saying he was “honored” to receive a nomination. He claimed there was “no Ken without Barbie.”</p><p>“I am extremely honored to be nominated by my colleagues alongside such remarkable artists in a year of so many great films,” the <a href=#>celebrity</a> said. “And I never thought I’d be saying this, but I’m also incredibly honored and proud that it’s for portraying a plastic doll named Ken.”</p><p>“But there is no Ken without Barbie, and there is no Barbie movie without Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie, the two people most responsible for this history-making, globally celebrated film. No recognition would be possible for anyone on the film without their talent, grit, and genius.</p><p>“To say that I’m disappointed that they are not nominated in their respective categories would be an understatement.</p><p>“Against all odds with nothing but a couple of soulless, scantily clad, and thankfully crotchless dolls, they made us laugh, they broke our hearts, they pushed the culture and they made history. Their work should be recognized along with the other very deserving nominees.”</p><p>“Having said that, I am so happy for America Ferrera and the other incredible artists who contributed their talents to making this such a groundbreaking film,” he concluded.</p><p>Amongst its nominations is the film’s catchy hit I’m Just Ken for Best Original Song, as well as What Was I Made For? by <a href=#>music</a> sensation Billie Eilish in the same category.</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Emmys: Christina Applegate is emotional as she receives standing ovation</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2eCcLzOpaCcnV2fvKyxjK2fnrGimnqqutWeqq2hl5bBqrrGZqSaqpekwW6%2BzpuZop1dl7KqusZmqaiakpqxbrvFZpinZZ%2BosKK%2Bjg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./zoe-saldana-fits-back-into-guardians-of-the-galaxy-bodysuit-after-welcoming-twins-photo-80388.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Zoe Saldana Fits Back Into Her Guardians of the Galaxy Bodysuit After Welcoming Twins  See ">&larr;
