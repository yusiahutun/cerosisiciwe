Russell Crowe</strong></p><p>Russell Crowe helped an aspiring actor achieve his dreams of attending the prestigious &nbsp;London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art!</p><p>After three years of auditioning, student Harry Pritchard was finally accepted into the school but found himself unable to pay the tuition.</p><p>He started a GoFundMe, telling supporters that he and his low income family couldn't afford the ¬£13,799 tuition and he had already missed the scholarship deadline by the time he was accepted.</p><p>After raising thousands of dollars, Russell stepped in and donated &nbsp;¬£2,741 to cover the rest of the tuition.</p><p>"Congratulations Harry.

She was incredibly shocked to be on the receiving end of her own huge scholarship!</p><p>"Thanks to Drake, I'm probably stressing about classes and work, but I'm not stressing about tuition. I'm here to tell future 'Canes to not be afraid of change and trust the process,'" Destiny told <a href=#>University of Miami News</a>.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:0af7137b-a329-4de5-8746-610b5ec51e4e data-container-ref=toofab:article:783c72fa-6c59-4bfd-b24e-214d715e0996 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/fd/5by4/2020/08/13/fda8691ffc2c4bdd9a4c9669e7d26253_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">YouTube</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">26 Relatable Songs Written About the Pandemic That Will Cover All Your Quarantine Emotions</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>4. Beyonce</strong></p><p>In 2017, Beyonce launched The Formation Scholars program, which aims "to encourage and support young women who are unafraid to think outside the box and are bold, creative, conscious, and confident."</p><p>The scholarship program provides aid to women studying creative arts, music, literature or African-American studies at Berklee College of Music, Howard University, Parsons School of Design, and Spelman College.</p><p><strong>5. Nicki Minaj</strong></p><p>Back in 2017, Nicki Minaj took to Twitter to offer financial assistance to her followers and ended up helping over 20 of her biggest fans.</p><p>Quite a few wrote in asking for help covering their tuition and Nicki said if she could get proof that they were keeping their grades up, she'd do it.</p><p>"Show me straight A's that I can verify w/ur school and I'll pay it. Who wants to join THAT contest?!?!ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Dead serious. Shld I set it up?"

Eddie Redmayne</strong></p><p>Eddie Redmayne knows it can be a struggle to live in London while attending drama school. That's why Eddie says he helps out students as much as he can, especially those that write to him about their financial difficulties.</p><p>"I get letters from people trying to go to drama school and needing to pay their rent. And so that's something I occasionally do. It's impossibly expensive to live in London," he told GQ.</p><p><strong>9. 21 Savage</strong></p><p>21 Savage teamed up with Get Schooled to launch a campaign to promote financial literacy among teens. During a 2018 appearance on "The Ellen Show," the rapper gave 21 teens $1000 to start their own bank accounts and use towards educational pursuits.</p><p>"While my #1 song was called 'Bank Account,' growing up, I knew almost nothing about bank accounts. As I have gotten smarter about financial management, I realize how empowering it is to control your money rather than be controlled by it. I want to help kids with a background similar to mine to get smart about their money," 21 Savage said in a press release.</p><p><strong>10. Tyrese Gibson</strong></p><p>Tyrese Gibson made a generous donation to Lorenzo Murphy's college fund, after the student caught his attention on social media. Tyrese presented Lorenzo a $50,000 scholarship in order to attend Morehouse College.</p><p>He says he was inspired by radio host Tom Joyner, <a href=#>writing</a>, "Why did I decide to put this young kid from Compton through college?? Because I #dream with my eyes OPEN and this year I watch this true legend get UP on stage and give the most moving speech about WHY he has raised and donated over 65 million dollars and put close to 30,000 african american kids into college and I decided at that MOMENT I needed to DO something."</p><p><strong>11. Lebron James</strong></p><p>Lebron James started the I Promise School back in 2018 for at-risk kids in his hometown of Akron, Ohio. Not only do these students get a great start, they also have the chance to receive a full scholarship to the University of Akron thanks to the LeBron James Family Foundation.</p><p><strong>12.
