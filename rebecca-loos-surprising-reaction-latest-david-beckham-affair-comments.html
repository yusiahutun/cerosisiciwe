Despite the backlash, some have come to Rebecca's defence.&nbsp;</p><p id=egAv6MGocG data-wc=36>One took to her Instagram comments and said: "Hope you're ok in light of everything sweetheart, and sincerely hope everyone is kind to you these days xxx," to which, Rebecca responded with a red heart emoji.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">Don't miss</h4><p id=e-wfmAxzQB data-wc=35>Another read: "Some of the comments on here are disgusting!!! Stay strong. You have a beautiful life with your gorgeous family which unlike others doesn't have to fill the gaps by getting Netflix involved!!! Xx."</p><p id=e8YHTS5JvR data-wc=24>Rebecca then replied defiantly: <strong>"Thank you [hands together emoji] am taking in the nasty comments with as much humour as I can [heart emoji]."</strong></p><p id=e5cLmWRUGR data-wc=43>The mum-of-two had shared a picture of herself doing yoga, in which she reflected: "Hello October. Letting go and finding strength in the mountains of life." According to MailOnline, <a class=hm-link href=#>Rebecca is now leading a very different life</a> as a yoga teacher in Norway.&nbsp;</p><p id=ebLh4242Z66 data-wc=10><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Harper Beckham and Nicola Peltz's sweetest sister moments revealed</a></p><p id=e9RMkGwC5XI data-wc=50>The 45-year-old is no longer in the limelight after appearing in various UK-based reality shows. She spoke to the publication about giving up the city for a "very different" life and looking after her "little Vikings" – her two sons, Magnus and Liam – whom she shares with husband Sven.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: David and Victoria Beckham reveal the impact alleged affair had on son Brooklyn Beckham</figure><p id=eZj6-yhTMO data-wc=55>The alleged affair was said to have happened in 2003 while David was playing for Real Madrid. In the documentary, Spice Girls star Victoria spoke out for the first time and claimed it was "the most unhappy I have ever been" when the infidelity reports made headlines. However, the couple have always denied the claims.&nbsp;</p><p id=ezydmvPKtJ data-wc=40>Speaking about how the paparazzi followed their every move, from leaving the house to during the school run, Victoria said: "It was an absolute circus – it's really entertaining when the circus comes to town, right? Unless you're in it."&nbsp;</p><p id=eteL_4SPL5 data-wc=31>She added: "It was very difficult for Brooklyn because he was older, and he had photographers screaming things. They used to scream things to Brooklyn about his mum and his dad."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/abd3b63b6137-david-beckham-netflix.jpg><p id=ehOfk_6RtQ data-wc=30>David then explained: "Brooklyn at the time was so young. He had to go through that and I don't know whether it's harmed him. I don't know, I don't know."&nbsp;</p><p id=emsXMRLAh5 data-wc=31>Asked if she "resented" her husband, fashion designer Victoria replied: "If I'm being totally honest, yes I did.

"Up until Madrid sometimes it felt like us against everybody else but we were together, we were connected, we had each other.&nbsp;</p><p id=e5jYPvGr7p data-wc=35>"But when we were in Spain, it didn't really feel like we had each other either.
