When asked about "Unity," he will suggest that you continue the conversation inside.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/49/screenshots/2023/09/640/talk-to-keeper-aquilus.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt="Talk to Keeper Aquilus" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><h3 class=he-c>2. Enter the Sanctum Universum / Talk to Keeper Aquilus</h3><p>Go inside the building, and sit on the chair located in his office to continue the conversation. Which options you choose during this conversation is of little importance. Eventually you will come to the conclusion that to find the answers you need to talk to the members of the House of Enlightenment and the House of Va'ruun.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/49/screenshots/2023/09/640/talk-to-keeper-aquilus-2.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt="Enter the Sanctum Universum / Talk to Keeper Aquilus" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><h3 class=he-c>3. Talk to the House of Enlightenment</h3><p>Keeper Aquilus believes there was a Pilgrim who kept the truth about "Unity" in a location hidden in stories told to the Sanctum Universum, the House of Enlightenment, and House Va'ruun.</p><p>To speak with the House of Enlightenment you should go to to The Well to where the House of Enlightenment is located. To get there you can use the elevator located near the MAST NAT Station. Once you are there, speak with Andy Singh, ask him about the Pilgrim, and listen to his version of the story.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/49/screenshots/2023/09/640/talk-to-the-house-of-enlightenment.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt="Talk to the House of Enlightenment" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><h3 class=he-c>4. Talk to the Va'ruun Prisoner</h3><p>To talk to the Va'ruun prisoner mentioned by Aquilus, you need to go to the UC Security Office building located near the space port. Talk to Mir'za which you can find in the prison section. Listen to her version of the story.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/49/screenshots/2023/09/640/talk-to-the-varuun-prisoner.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt="Talk to the Va'ruun Prisoner" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><h3 class=he-c>5. Return to Keeper Aquilus</h3><p>I now have three clues to the Pilgrim's final resting place. "Infinitum addendum," "Second," and "Four and One-Hundred Twenty."</p><p>Head back to Keeper Aquilus to tell him about what you learned. Eventually you'll arrive at the name of a planet to investigate. Eventually, you will come to the conclusion that the clues are a kind of coordinates pointing to the planet Indum II.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/49/screenshots/2023/09/640/return-to-keeper-aquilus-2.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt="Return to Keeper Aquilus" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><h3 class=he-c>6. Go to Indum II</h3><p>I think I know the Unity Pilgrim's final resting place. It's on the second planet of the Indum system.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/49/screenshots/2023/09/640/go-to-indum-ii.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt="Go to Indum II" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><h3 class=he-c>7. Go to "Pilgrim's Rest"</h3><p>After landing, go to the marked location. When you get a little closer to the destination, the mission objective will change to a new one.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/49/screenshots/2023/09/640/go-to-pilgrims-rest.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt='Go to "Pilgrim&#39;s Rest"' style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><h3 class=he-c>8. Search for Clues on "Unity"</h3><p>I think I've found the resting place of the Pilgrim that Keeper Aquilus spoke about. I should look around and see if he's left anything that tells me about Unity.</p><p>This objective will be completed when you open the door to the locked room located in the main building. To do so, you must know the answers to the questions. The clues to them can be found in the books that can be found within Pilgrim's Rest area.</p><p>You will find one of the books under the yellow canopy.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/49/screenshots/2023/09/640/pilgrims-writing-2.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt='Search for Clues on "Unity"' style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><p>So here is the crux of my troubles. To accomplish anything, I need to work with other people. I need assistants; I need workers; I need hands.</p><p>As we work together, they inevitably ask questions and I can never help talking. It starts innocently enough -- they want to understand how someone who believes in science can also believe in the divine. Or they have their own misunderstanding instilled by some borderline religious remnant. My weakness is my inability to let alone. I want them to understand. So I try, gently as I might, to nudge their minds along the right path.</p><p>Then there are followups and followings. The trouble is that I genuinely care for these people. It would be so much easier if I didn't.</p><p>You'll find two more books in a small ruined greenhouse.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/49/screenshots/2023/09/640/pilgrims-writing-4.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt='Search for Clues on "Unity"' style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><p>At last a bit of peace. A piece of peace. Is that anything? Is that funny? Why am I trying to be funny? Have they driven ME mad at last? Is there a difference between writing to myself and talking to myself? The former certainly seems more acceptable than the latter.</p><p>I recall again that my mind is my own, and that even if only it exists, that is sufficient for me to believe in everything else. The Unity has restored me once more. This time I act alone. For now.</p><p>Myself is a formidable opponent. I should have expected as much, but vanity is, thankfully, not among my vices. Regardless -- it turns out time spent in solitude is, in my case, time with a very sick man. Or whatever it is I have become.</p><p>I don't like this person.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/49/screenshots/2023/09/640/pilgrims-writing-3.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt='Search for Clues on "Unity"' style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><p>Today, in a soft voice, my assistant asked me if there was anything above the Unity. It was all I could do to keep from shouting that I could scarcely comprehend the misunderstanding that would lead to such a question.</p><p>It was asked honestly and I answered as best I could, but if even my closest confidant here can fail to grasp the most basic of these truths, why am I bothering to explain any of it to any of them? Every word that drops from my mouth gets gobbled up, misheard, misremembered, misunderstood, and mistranslated before I can issue the slightest clarification.</p><p>People are necessary. But people are madness.</p><p>I attempted to withdraw, to go off alone, to commune with Unity in my own way. They followed. Of course they followed.</p><p>The last two books are located in the main building.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/49/screenshots/2023/09/640/pilgrims-writing-1.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt='Search for Clues on "Unity"' style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><p>The credulous simplicity of mundane humans never ceases to amaze me. My worst instincts (the evil spirit!) draw me towards a form of contempt for them, but I remember that I am privy to that which they are not.</p><p>I cannot and should not judge them for a lack of vision when I know very well the blinders which obscure their sight. I once wore them myself, after all. I hope for their sake that they may some day understand, but for my sake I wish to be left alone.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/49/screenshots/2023/09/640/pilgrims-writing-5.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt='Search for Clues on "Unity"' style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><p>I find myself thinking about his various pasts and my possible futures. I imagine continuing on the road, acquiring more power, more knowledge, more development of myself. I imagine passing through once more to another world to begin the process anew.</p><p>What is notable here: that road does seem gratifying. Every step is one of intrinsic reward, and I feel myself anticipating the pleasures and seeing a more contented version of myself in that future.</p><p>Then, for the sake of considering all possibilities, I imagine if I took a different path. If I stopped running, stopped seeking to gather my own power. If I instead embraced the twinges of compassion I feel in my heart, and let myself care for the people who seem to gather about me wherever I try to work. If I simply lived, and taught, and perhaps brought others to the light. And died.</p><p>That road also seems gratifying. I also see a contented version of myself in that future.</p><p>Here is the difference, though: when I stop thinking about the glories I could achieve for myself, the pleasure fades nearly immediately. When I stop thinking about staying and building something, the feeling endures. There is something more sustaining about it, more fulfilling.</p><p>I don't know what this difference signifies. But I am grateful for the time I've taken to notice it.</p><h3 class=he-c>10. Search the Room / Read "Pilgrim's Final Writing"</h3><p>Enter the room and read the book "<strong>Pilgrim's Final Writing</strong>".</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/49/screenshots/2023/09/640/search-the-room.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt='Search the Room / Read "Pilgrim&#39;s Final Writing"' style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><p>I don't know what the correct answer is. I might never. Increasingly, though, I am comfortable with not knowing. The more I reflect on being here, in this world, in this time, the more I think it is precisely where I need to be.</p><p>This time will be different. It won't be about me, so I won't have to run. I can actually build something with intent instead of scrambling to fix something that others create in my name. It can be something beneficial. I can be something beneficial.</p><p>I'm leaving behind that other person. This world has no place for him. Let him die. Let me live to enlighten the blessed universe before me.</p><p>You have found the end of my journey, but to know everything, you must find its beginning.</p><p>On Hyla II, the island hides the scorpion, and the scorpion's sting hides the truth.</p><p>Before you leave this room also take the "<strong>Trackers Primer 02</strong>" magazine that lies on the shelf.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/49/screenshots/2023/09/640/trackers-primer-02.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt='Search the Room / Read "Pilgrim&#39;s Final Writing"' style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><h3 class=he-c>11.

There are four of them, left, right, upper and lower. To solve this puzzle, you need to use them to move a ray of light coming from above to the lower left of the constellation drawn on the circle on the ground, so that it shines directly on the last star of the constellation. In my case, it was enough that I used the lower glyph once and the left glyph three times.</p><p><span class=screenshot><a href=# data-lightbox=quest-stage-640><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.guides4gamers.com/sites/49/screenshots/2023/09/640/find-the-scorpions-sting-on-hyla-ii-3.jpg decoding=async width=640 height=360 alt='Find the "Scorpion&#39;s Sting" on Hyla II' style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifpZ6xpr%2BToJimnaKoe6S7zGiqrZmim7amuMNoqK6do6l8trrIrbBo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./abbie-chatfield-loses-thousands-instagram-followers-posing-completely-naked-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Abbie Chatfield loses thousands of Instagram followers after posing completely naked">&larr;
