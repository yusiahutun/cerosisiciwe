Bob Mackie asked when tasked with dressing Cher for an appearance on The Carol Burnett Show with Sonny Bono in 1967. Mackie served as the show's costume designer and the famous duo was guest-starring on a sketch. What started as a styling conundrum led to one of the greatest designer-celebrity collaborations of all time.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Fast forward to 50-plus years later and Mackie is still working with Cher. The designer is responsible for nearly all the looks that transformed the superstar into a fashion icon, from that feathered naked dress at the 1974 Met Gala to that showgirl-inspired look at the 1986 Oscars. So when it came time for someone to design costumes for the Broadway adaptation of Cher's life, The Cher Show, there was only one person for the job: Bob Mackie.<br></p><img alt="Fashion illustration, Costume design, Fashion design, Purple, Fashion, Formal wear, Victorian fashion, Belly dance, Dance, Illustration, " title="Fashion illustration, Costume design, Fashion design, Purple, Fashion, Formal wear, Victorian fashion, Belly dance, Dance, Illustration, " width=3452 height=5198 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bobmackiesketch-1551992068.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Bob Mackie</span><p>Mackie's sketches for three different eras across Cher's life.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The musical, which debuted in December, features over 600 costumes. Sparkles, feathers, towering headpieces: The Cher Show doesn't just turn back time through the icon's life and career; it also takes you through her fashion evolution, with all new looks designed by the great costumer himself. One of the standout highlights is an incredible fashion show scene (aptly called 'The Bob Mackie number'), which eclipses any rom-com dress-up montage or makeover scene.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">BAZAAR.com caught up with Mackie to talk designing for The Cher Show, how he first met Cher, and what he thinks of celebrities (ahem, Kim Kardashian) recreating his famous naked dress look today.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong><strong>On how he first met Cher:</strong></strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"She was guest starring with Sonny on The Carol Burnett Show in the first year of the show [1967]. I looked at the script and they told me Sonny and Cher would be guests and we were doing a Show Boat-themed finale. I said, ‘What am I going to do with Sonny and Cher?!’ At that time, they were wearing fur vests and didn’t crack a smile too often—they were like New Age cavemen. But then she came in for a fitting and she was adorable and just so cute. She wasn’t very tall, she was 5’6—the same height as Sonny actually. I dressed her all up in these ruffles and she was cute as can be. I just thought, ‘Boy, I like this girl, this is something.’ A couple years later we started working together again. I would dress her up and it was really fun. I got to know her really well and then they got an offer, after playing Vegas for a couple of years, from CBS to do a summer replacement show. Usually those shows are big flops because nobody watches TV in the summers, but theirs was a huge hit and led to their own weekly show."</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>On dressing Cher for the Sonny and Cher Show:</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"She would have up to 20 costumes for an hour-long show. It might be on camera for 30 seconds or 10 minutes, but she wore lots and lots of clothes so she became this amazing clothes horse. I could get a piece of beautiful matte jersey and we could make her a dress in 10 minutes because her body was incredible to work with. She looked good in so many things, the more interesting and exotic, the better. She said one time, 'I’m like your fucking Barbie!!'"</p><img alt="Entertainment, Performing arts, Event, Dance, Performance, Musical, Performance art, Tango, Musical theatre, Dancer, " title="Entertainment, Performing arts, Event, Dance, Performance, Musical, Performance art, Tango, Musical theatre, Dancer, " width=960 height=800 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-sonny-cher-show-embed-1552018341.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">/Courtesy The Cher Show</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Left: Sonny and Cher in 1973; Right: Jarrod Spector and Teal Wicks as Sonny and Cher in the Broadway musical.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="body-h2 css-12zwj0s emevuu60"><strong>On Cher, Diana Ross, and Carol Burnett sharing his designs:</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Diana [Ross] was a good friend of Cher’s, so every now and then she would be like ‘Oh, I’m going on The Tonight Show, can I borrow something? You have so many things!’ because she watched The Cher Show. A couple of times she borrowed dresses [from Cher], which I thought was so funny. It’s interesting because at CBS, Sonny and Cher were in one studio and next door was The Carol Burnett Show, so I would be running back and forth checking things like crazy. The two ladies [Carol and Cher] themselves were almost identical in measurements, but nobody would ever think that. Whenever there was a crazy costume or something specific like a Minnie Mouse costume, I’d be like 'Oh I made one for Carol years ago, let’s just rent it from the show.' That happened over and over again."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="body-h2 css-12zwj0s emevuu60"><strong>On deciding which of Cher’s many looks to recreate for the Broadway musical:</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"She’s worn so many fun outfits personally, but in the show, very often she doesn’t leave stage for a long time, so we would do a jacket change or even at one point she gets into her Josephine costume over her jumpsuit. It wasn’t exactly easy [to fit all the looks in], but it was fun. We had a good time."</p><img alt="Performance, Event, Fashion, Performing arts, Fun, Stage, " title="Performance, Event, Fashion, Performing arts, Fun, Stage, " width=3000 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1068187374.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>The three Cher stars of the Broadway show—Stephanie J.

It’s really interesting watching the audience [during the performance] because there’s all kinds of different people having the best time: people [who remember] that time and then there’s a whole bunch of young ones who are excited too. They go crazy over the outfits."</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>On inspiring today's naked dress trend with Cher's iconic 1974 Met Gala look:</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I don’t think there was a big phenomenon in 1975, but just recently and the last couple of years at the Met Ball. All of a sudden they [celebrities] were coming up to Cher and telling her, 'We were inspired by your dress!' And they’d go online and look at all these old outfits of hers I designed.

I went with Cher, I was her date to the Met Ball in December 1974. People dressed up then, but not really dressed up like that. She walked in, and there I am standing next to her, and all of the sudden there were like a thousand photographers swarming us. They followed her the entire evening. There was a big dinner and we sat at Diana Vreeland’s table. It was all very fun and I had things in the exhibit as well, so it was very exciting. It was the Hollywood exhibit and there were lots of movie and TV clothes. I look at those pictures now and I look like I’m 12!"</p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60"><strong>On how he feels about Kim Kardashian looking to his old designs for inspiration:</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I don’t know her at all.
