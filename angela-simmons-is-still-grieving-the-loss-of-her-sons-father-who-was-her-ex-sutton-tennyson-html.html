She’s made her main focus on raising their son and building her fitness business to remain busy and positive.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-630258086.jpg><p id=par-2_58>But a recent episode of <a href=#>Growing Up Hip Hop</a> revealed that the daughter of Rev Run is having a hard time processing his death and explaining it to their toddler son. Sutton <a href=#>was gunned down</a> in front of his Atlanta home in 2018 and Simmons has made it her mission to keep his memory alive for their son.</p><h2><strong>Angela Simmons and Sutton Tennyson’s relationship&nbsp;</strong></h2><p id=par-3_37>Most people didn’t even know that Simmons was in a relationship until the then 28-year-old <a href=#>announced that she was pregnant</a>. Fans were shocked as Simmons previously publicly declared that she was maintaining her virginity until she married.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p>Source: YouTube</figure><p id=par-4_54>According to Simmons, she met Tennyson, fell in love and her plans changed. She later revealed on the WeTV reality series Growing Up Hip Hop that she got pregnant the first time she and Tennyson were intimate. She admitted that the public scrutiny she fell under for was tough to deal with at times.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p>Source: YouTube</figure><p id=par-5_70>“Well, I publicly spoke about it and a lot of people knew that I was a virgin and I waited until I was like 28, and I went from virgin to pregnant. So it was a lot and it was in public,” she told Dr. Oz in a 2019 episode. A lot of people were like, ‘Were you lying or what happened?’ But it just happened really quick for me.”</p><p id=par-6_17>Soon after her pregnancy, she announced on Instagram that she and Tennyson were engaged in April 2016.</p><p id=par-7_46>“YES!! I couldn’t be more excited. This is only something I could of only dreamed of. I’m over the moon and feeling so blessed to be able to share my life with the one I truly love. Everything happened in the most perfect way,” she wrote.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-4>Source: Instagram</figure><p id=par-8_48>Their son, Sutton Tennyson Jr., was born in September 2016 and they split in December of the same year. In May 2018, she <a href=#>opened up about their breakup</a> and said she ended things after months of being unhappy in an emotional conversation with her mom on the show.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_59>“I just got to a place where I felt like I wasn’t happy, and I tried, and I tried, and I tried and I wanted it to work because the last thing I wanted to do was not be together with the person I had my child with,” she admitted in a confessional. “God had another plan for me.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-5><p></p>Source: YouTube</figure><p id=par-10_19>The two later battled in court in a <a href=#>secret custody case</a> but <a href=#>Tennyson was tragically killed</a> in November 2018.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Who was Sutton Tennyson?</strong></h2><p id=par-11_38>Everyone wanted to know who the mystery man was that snagged Simmons’ heart, especially after having high profile relationships with the likes of Bow Wow, and a close friendship with her Growing Up Hip Hop co-star, Romeo Miller.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-6><p></p>Source: YouTube</figure><p id=par-12_39>Tennyson was born and raised in Atlanta. Though he kept his professional life under wraps during his relationship with Simmons, he is said to have been a businessman and an investor with several business dealings in the Atlanta area.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-13_51>The split with Simmons was rumored to be tough. She received temporary custody of their son in July 2018 after filing for an order of protection against Tennyson in the immediate aftermath of their split, <a href=#>according to Page Six</a>. Simmons alleged that she experienced domestic violence at the hands of Tennyson.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-7>Source: Instagram</figure><p id=par-14_57>While they were dating, <a href=#>Bossip also reported</a> that Tennyson encountered legal issues and served two stints in prison in his past. Despite what may look like a troubled past and a bad breakup, Simmons insisted that Tennyson was a good man and a good father to their son. Even after they split, she never publicly blasted him.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-15_15>After Tennyson’s death, Simmons posted a heartfelt message to her Instagram account in his honor.</p><p id=par-16_48>“Thank you for leaving behind my greatest gift . I’m hurting . I’m numb. Thank you for the out pouring of love everyone . I cant believe I’m even saying Rest In Peace Sutton .
