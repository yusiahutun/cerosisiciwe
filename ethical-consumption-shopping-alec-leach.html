I realize they will change my life. I buy them, they are gingerly wrapped in tissue paper and slipped into a box, and my life, indeed, is changed.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This is a fantasy, obviously, one that in many ways has never been real (especially that last part). But it is true that shopping used to be about slower, more satisfying pleasures. Over the past decade—and particularly over the last five years, with the boom in ultra-fast fashion—the great American pastime of shopping has gotten broken. Just take a look at the hashtag for <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/sheinhaul?lang=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=#sheinhaul data-vars-ga-product-id=709d25e5-3793-4ae4-9969-cdbe69ed8b52 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/sheinhaul?lang=en" data-product-url="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/sheinhaul?lang=en" data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2Ftag%2Fsheinhaul%3Flang%3Den" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-brand=#sheinhaul data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=35cc174e-b144-4242-a3fc-1127c56a06f7 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand=#sheinhaul class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">#sheinhaul</a> on TikTok. In these videos, women recount the pieces they’ve purchased on the fast-fashion retailer’s app, where most garments cost between $5 and $17. In many cases, they’ve spent a few hundred dollars, which might get you one deeply discounted party dress at a department store, but from Shein nets you a mountain of plastic-wrapped baggies. In late April, the company was valued at over $100 billion, making it one of the largest unicorn companies in the world, essentially tied with rocket manufacturer SpaceX. It’s a far cry from the soft tissue enveloping a single (if pretty expensive!) pair of elegant boots.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Fast fashion and Shein in particular are often cited in reports about the climate crisis and fashion’s role in it. Even if the industry’s reputation as the biggest polluter in the world <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/fashion/fashion-second-biggest-polluter-fake-news.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="is indeed a myth" data-vars-ga-product-id=e320736e-29da-4bad-9015-3a1b5c3a0552 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/fashion/fashion-second-biggest-polluter-fake-news.html data-product-url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/fashion/fashion-second-biggest-polluter-fake-news.html data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2018%2F12%2F18%2Ffashion%2Ffashion-second-biggest-polluter-fake-news.html" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=3ae46548-9e50-45cb-b7b3-a11cb634932b class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">is indeed a myth</a>, fashion is still a business that thrives on convincing consumers we need more stuff. During the COVID-19 pandemic, when travel and other forms of entertainment were impossible, shopping online (especially with the once-in-a-lifetime discounts on offer) became more popular than ever as a leisure activity. Social media has encouraged us—even those of us beyond the standard Shein demographic, which skews heavily Gen Z—to adopt a habit of wearing something once and discarding it, whether you do so on Poshmark or The RealReal or just toss it in the trash.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This pains me, because I love to shop. I recently found a $7 T-shirt on Shein, featuring a skeleton relaxing in a shopping cart and giving a peace sign. The skeleton was wearing a cute little outfit that itself could have easily been cobbled together on Shein, and the text with the illustration read: “Live your best life.” I felt like I was witnessing a piece of propaganda for shopping’s horrible future. This is what businesses like Shein hope for us: The afterlife is a store. We are a product. We are dead—and loving it.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the midst of all this madness comes a slender new manifesto in glossy black, by British writer Alec Leach: <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://alecleach.com/store-1/p/the-world-is-on-fire-but-were-still-buying-shoes data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The World Is on Fire but We’re Still Buying Shoes" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The World Is on Fire but We’re Still Buying Shoes</a>. Leach, a former style editor for fashion and culture website Highsnobiety, is now a consultant specializing in sustainability, and also started <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/future__dust/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Future Dust" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Future Dust</a>, an Instagram account dedicated to sustainable fashion. He tells me in a conversation this spring that while most of the discourse around sustainability and shopping is about getting us to stop shopping, he is more interested in ways to guide us toward a better relationship with fashion, including how we acquire our clothes. “The sustainability efforts mean nothing so long as our shopping habits keep on getting more and more excessive,” he says. “Consumption is projected to only increase over the coming decade.”</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>You are not opting out of fashion, but rather becoming a more active observer.<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Shopping is a distraction so much of the time,” he reflects. “It can be something that really brings something to your life, but only when it’s done intentionally.” In other words, he wants us to become more mindful shoppers.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Leach comes from the streetwear world, and spent years trapped in its miasma of hyped products and drops—a system that, as he outlines in The World Is on Fire, creates an environment in which consumers are barraged multiple times a year with products marketed as extremely limited, artificially increasing the urgency to buy. But his lessons about how to develop a smarter relationship to clothes are equally applicable to the fast fashion and trend-mania of womenswear. The chilling book can be read in under an hour—and you’ll emerge a more mindful shopper. How do we reach the kind of pure nirvana Leach points at? (Can there, indeed, be ethical consumption under capitalism?)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">One of the keys is to avoid faddish mindsets like the one that has dominated fashion discourse over the past several months. The boom of fast-fashion retailers like Shein has made it seem like a huge amount of people are doing something incredibly niche all at once, which simply isn’t true. Shein has no identifiable aesthetic, but rather seeks to offer the possibility of hopping on every trend at every moment. (One day last month while perusing the app, I saw for sale a pair of sweatpants that read “STOP LOOKING AT MY BUTT” and a pair that read “I DON’T HAVE A BUTT.” Perhaps this is part of the brand’s <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://fashionunited.com/news/fashion/shein-dropped-a-body-inclusive-virtual-fashion-show/2022022145965 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="specious efforts" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">specious efforts</a> to encourage size inclusivity.) Designers like Jerry Lorenzo, of Fear of God, are <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/fashion-week/a39631139/fear-of-god-eternal-jerry-lorenzo-interview/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="already speaking to a customer" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">already speaking to a customer</a> who’s sick of this constant (and suspicious) churn of trendiness, but you don’t have to adopt a uniform of understated suiting to live and shop more mindfully. Simply investing in your own sense of personal style can make you a more sustainable shopper, as you figure out what you really like and how you can work those trends into your existing wardrobe. (This was the subject of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.gq.com/story/sustainable-fashion-personal-style data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="an essay I wrote in early 2020" data-vars-ga-product-id=5177d362-2d04-4fc0-a413-d1ced360bae8 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.gq.com/story/sustainable-fashion-personal-style data-product-url=https://www.gq.com/story/sustainable-fashion-personal-style data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gq.com%2Fstory%2Fsustainable-fashion-personal-style" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-brand=gq data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=60926006-bac5-4ec0-a991-c84f22a859fe data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand=gq class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">an essay I wrote in early 2020</a>, which Leach mentions in his book.) In 2017, for example, I bought a pair of sneakers from Virgil Abloh’s original collection for Nike. I kept wearing them even when, around 2019, fashion snobs decided they were passé. Of course, they are now collector’s items, which is the kind of cycle that any person who really believes in their style is destined for. By shopping mindfully, you are not opting out of fashion (which would be very sad, anyway), but becoming a more active observer of it. In fact, you should still let fashion seduce you, and notice yourself falling prey to its irrational pull. Just also remember that does not necessarily mean buying whatever it is that has captured your heart. At the very least, the objects of your affection should really work to win a place in your life.<br></p><img alt="alec leach book" title="alec leach book" width=1500 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/unknown-1658182091.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Carys Huws.</span><p>Alec Leach, author of The World Is on Fire but We’re Still Buying Shoes</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After investing in your personal style, the second step is to become an excellent browser, and to develop a deeper (even spiritual) relationship to your belongings. Shopping often results in a feeling of lack or loss, but it doesn’t have to. In Leach’s book, there’s a graph showing what we think a new item will do for us, versus what actually happens, versus what should happen. We buy a piece and imagine our lives will improve (as I described above). Instead, the product doesn’t live up to our expectations. (They usually don’t.) When you buy clothing carefully, though, or thoughtfully, or with an affirmative sense that the garment in question can give you confidence or joy or even just pleasure, the line goes up, and stays steady, until (hopefully many years later) you’ve worn it so much, it’s no longer decent or able to be repaired.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Independent retailers in particular, says Leach, who is now based in Berlin, can be fonts of knowledge about products and brands. “Some of these places do genuinely have such an amazing way of being able to present the context around things in a way that I just think is really awesome,” he says, naming in particular Très Bien and Voo Store, based in Sweden and Germany, respectively, but available to shop internationally. “I think now is definitely a really good time to start to think about brick-and-mortar again. People also just forget what you can kind of get out of retailers. If I was looking for a cobbler, I would just ring up one of the stores in Berlin and [ask]: ‘Who’s your cobbler?’ And they’d tell me!” (I have a guy at an independent boutique in SoHo with whom I have such a great shopping rapport that he’ll tell me when someone has had a bad season, and suggest I save up instead for the next season.)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Think of shopping as research and knowledge collecting, in other words—your chance to not only see how a particular item fits and feels, but also learn more generally about the brand’s universe. Think about how it fits into your wardrobe and into your life. Does it feel aspirational, pragmatic, realistic? (There are no wrong answers here!) Is the silhouette or the fabric something you already have a lot of? Once you develop more scrutiny, you’ll find that fewer things live up to your standards, and you’ll simply buy less.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But even better, you’ll have things you really love. Last spring, I put in a number of gleeful browsing sessions when Jonathan Anderson’s Spring 2021 collection for Loewe started coming into stores. That was one of the first collections I’d covered extensively during the first round of “pandemic Fashion Weeks.” I had treasured the books and other strange ephemera Anderson had sent to journalists, and had a handful of long, weird conversations with the designer about where everything was going and how everything felt, plus what kind of art and photography he was looking at.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Loewe’s pieces are very often outside my own budget, but I certainly fantasized about the life I’d have in a totally wackadoo blue knitted sequin skirt and top that dragged to the ground and tied into knots, like a washed-up mermaid’s uniform. Eventually, I began plotting purchasing it as a sort of keepsake of the season when I felt like I’d really become a fashion critic. I spent three months chucking money away for it and finally hunted it down on a deep discount. And every time I wear it, I feel like I’m actually on the line of fantastical ascent predicted by the dream of buying. That’s not the case with everything I own, but it’s the standard I have in mind.<br></p><img alt="loewe ss21" title="loewe ss21" width=2240 height=3360 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/loewe-spring-2021-1658181898.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Loewe.</span><p>The Loewe Spring 2021 look I copped</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This isn’t just for big fancy purchases and eventwear, of course. It has to be an everyday practice. Leach says this is true of the hoodie he’s wearing while we talk, for example—it’s something he hunted for, and truly believes in. “It is really annoying shopping that way,” he admits. “It takes a really long time—it’s taken me so long to find a hoodie that I really love. You really have to put work in.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“But when you get it,” he says, looking up at the ceiling in joy, “you’re just like, Okay, this is perfect.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This story has been updated.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/eb92ba9d-3e4d-4650-b9c7-eff7aa4ac591_1647626609.PNG?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Rachel Tashjian" title="Headshot of Rachel Tashjian" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Rachel Tashjian is the Fashion News Director at Harper’s Bazaar, working across print and digital platforms.
