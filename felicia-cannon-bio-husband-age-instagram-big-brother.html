She elaborated on that, “I’ve always looked at myself as a people person, as a social person, as a relationship person. And this is going to let me know if how I’ve always seen myself is how other people see me. I believe I know how to strategize and play all the little different things you need to do to get to the end.”</p><p>The Washington native believes that her age and experience are an advantage for her. But advantage alone is not going to bring home the title so she is equipped with strategy on how she will be playing this. She told Parade, “My strategy is to be my authentic Felicia, build relationships, build trust. And then from there, wherever the game takes me it takes me, have fun. I want to have fun.”</p><p>Felicia is confident that she will or should win. “I really believe that I’m going to win because I believe I have all the skill sets and experience in life, and just my ability to again connect and read people, “In that aspect, she explained. “I really believe that my natural self is going to carry me to the end. I believe that.”</p><h3><strong>Felicia Cannon Age</strong></h3><p>Felicia Cannon was born in June 1960.

It kept turning, it itched, and I sweat in my head… I thought about hair implants until they told me they take hair from other places on my head and with a needle, they implant it into the bald areas.”</p><p>Felicia later shaved off all of her hair and decided to be proud of it. She added, “I put on earrings and lipstick and go about my day. It’s all about how you see yourself. I realized I am not defined by my hair. I am empowered without it… I don’t need to be defended or protected because I’m bald. I don’t see myself as having a disease, just a circumstance that I had to get accustomed to. My smile didn’t change cause I lost my hair.”</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>When Is Felicia Cannon Birthday?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Felicia Cannon celebrates her birthday on 18 June.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Is Felicia Cannon From?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Felicia Cannon is originally from Tacoma, Washington.
