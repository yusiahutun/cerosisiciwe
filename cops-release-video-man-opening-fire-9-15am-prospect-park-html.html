Hip-hop has accumulated a strong following in Brooklyn and is blamed as a factor in the recent rise of gun violence targeting up-and-coming rappers.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>NYPD&nbsp;Deputy Chief Joseph Gulotta,&nbsp;who works in Brooklyn South, believes the recent rise of gang-related gun violence is possibly being stoked by the&nbsp;<span style=font-size:16px>drill rap scene and its aggressive lyrics.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'The music definitely inflames the situation,' Gulotta told the New York Daily News. 'But these are gang shootings. I think sometimes rap and the lyrics ignite&nbsp; - cause some issues. But I don't think that's the underlying motive at the end of the day.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Violent crime has surged across the country in recent years, especially in New York City, with many different factors including increased tensions between the police and public, unemployment rates, soft-on-crime politicians and bail reform being blamed.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>While murders are down nearly 13 percent at this time over last year, shootings have increased almost 30 percent. Overall crime in the Big Apple has skyrocketed 41.65 percent.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>There is a long history connecting gun violence and gang rivalries with hip-hop, but the feuds go beyond the music.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'These are ongoing gang disputes in the same geographical area,' Gulotta said. 'Can they be connected? They sure could. These are longstanding beefs between these groups and they're right there on top of each other.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>While the NYPD chief thinks that the music could be helping to fan the flames between the conflicting groups,&nbsp;sometimes the harsh lyrics help police piece the crimes together.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'They'll talk about what they're going to do,' Gulotta explained. 'They'll talk about the past.'&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>RELATED ARTICLES</h2><ul class="rotator-pages link-xocc"><li class=rotator-prev><a href=# data-page=prev>Previous</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=1>1</a></li><li class=rotator-next><a href=# data-page=next>Next</a></li></ul><ul class="rotator-panels link-bogr1 linkro-ccox"><li><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/02/08/22/53923653-0-image-a-8_1644358480664.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>NYC's Drill music scene is fueling latest surge in gun...</span></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/02/05/04/53799337-0-image-m-51_1644034615693.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>Nearly naked gunman who shot and killed four people at a...</span></a></li></ul><h2>Share this article</h2><span class=wai>Share</span> <img id=i-5856935c0c0fa893 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/02/08/18/53930469-10490299-image-a-68_1644344077289.jpg height=933 width=634 alt="Crime has risen significantly in NYC, with overall crime up almost 42 per cent and shooting victims are up almost 30 per cent" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Crime has risen significantly in NYC, with overall crime up almost 42 per cent and shooting victims are up almost 30 per cent&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'You've got all kinds of crazy alliances with these gangs.
