And this was before I’d had to contend with the bewildering reactions of the opposite sex.</span><br></p><p><span>It wasn’t until I moved from my girls’ school to a sixth form college at the age of 16 that I became painfully aware of the rubbernecking and widening eyes that my breasts elicited from hormonal young males.</span><br></p><p><span>That’s when I started wearing the baggy black T-shirts.</span><br></p><p><span>I’m sure there are many women who would imagine such attention boosts your confidence, but in&nbsp;reality it’s uncomfortable, humiliating and you just want to run away and hide. So distraught was I with my breasts in my late teens that I visited the doctor to inquire about a reduction.</span><br></p><p><span>My GP warned me such operations come with big risks and suggested that, in time, I might grow to love my breasts.</span><br></p><p><span>After his well-meaning words, I didn’t pursue the idea of a breast&nbsp;reduction, but I continued to torture myself with physical comparisons to my svelte best friend, Christine.</span><br></p><br><p style=font-weight:700;color:#d42699><span>Size matters</span></p><p style=font-weight:700;color:#d42699><span>The best-selling bra size is 34DD - that compares to 34B in 2010, according to Debenhams</span></p><p><span>Whenever we had sleep-overs, I’d watch how she slipped effortlessly into her pyjamas. When I got changed, my breasts swung from side to side in cumbersome and clumsy unison.</span></p><p><span>When I went to university in Hull, I found myself gravitating towards other busty girls.</span><br></p><p><span>My housemate’s cleavage was as eye-popping as mine. We endured vulgar taunts about our bosoms, but took comfort in the fact we were not alone.</span><br></p><p><span>I never dressed revealingly for dates when I was young and, even now, I refuse to display my cleavage when meeting potential suitors. I just want a man who will love me for me — and that includes my whole body and my brain.</span><br></p><p><span>Meanwhile, my nights out in bars and clubs continue to be dominated by vulgar comments about my chest.</span><br></p><p><span>As a woman with a larger-than-life personality, I tend to laugh off such comments. But there are times when I go home feeling genuinely upset.</span><br></p><p><span>Would these men say anything if I was flat-chested? Or big-bottomed? I don't think so.</span><br></p><p><span>Thanks to Holly Willoughby and her ilk, curvy women with big boobs are considered to be fair game for ribald comments from strangers.</span><br></p><p><span>As at this time of year, I’m dreading having to strip down to a bikini on holiday.<br></span></p><p><span></span> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/04/17/article-2310619-0CBC1FDC000005DC-353_634x413.jpg height=413 width=634 alt="Unwelcome attention: Christina Hendricks character in Mad Men her womanly curves but Jenny is not proud of hers" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p class=imageCaption>Unwelcome attention: Christina Hendricks' character in Mad Men flaunts her womanly curves but Jenny is not proud of hers</p><p><span>Girls with big busts tend to look like budding porn stars, even if they choose the classiest two-piece on the block (which will have to employ heavy scaffolding and cost at least £50). The extent to which my god-forsaken breasts put a dampener on everything is best summed up by a recent phone call.</span><br></p><p><span>It was my sister Pamela, 25, ringing to tell me she was engaged and she’d like me to be her matron of honor.</span><br></p><p><span>Of course, I congratulated her, but my very first question was: ‘Do I have to wear a strapless bridesmaid’s dress?’</span><br></p><p><span>Forget inquiries about the venue, the number of guests, how she was feeling — my fears about my figure clouded my reaction to her happy news.</span><br></p><p><span>I admit this makes me feel silly, childish and a bit sad. I do wish I could learn to accept my body.</span><br><span>Thankfully, Pamela is very laid-back and assured me that I could wear whatever made me feel most comfortable.</span><br></p><p><span>So I would say to Holly Willoughby, and all those women who revel in comments about their breasts, to think again and&nbsp;realise that not every big-busted girl is happy to be judged by her boobs alone.</span><br><span>I, for one, feel better having got that all off my chest.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaJ6Voq6quI6aqa2hk6Gybn6SamdvaWlkmqa6jKCYsKhdrLyusc1mnKeuqWKPtsCMbGt%2FZZKnsqK%2F06xkm5memnqttcWeZI6mnJ64pnmnqKOlsV2Mtq24zq6eoZqpYsSztdOeqWZ8f3qgbrnIp5tmqJWkva2xjJ%2BgsZmknruoecKlnJqukZyyb7TTpqM%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./germany-business-report-april-2019.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Refrigeration expert Gntner brings high-quality heating and cooling products to Asia">&larr;
