But as the nominations for the <a href=#>Emmy Award</a> were read out, he couldn’t help but snack on something tasty. It was only when Paul Walter Hauser’s name was read out on stage that he had to stop what he was eating to walk to the microphone. Now, the <a href=#>movie</a> star has explained what he was munching on. But more importantly, why he had the snack in the first place.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-paul-walter-hauser-eating-while-winning-at-the-emmys-is-iconic>Paul Walter Hauser eating while winning at the Emmys is iconic</h2><p>His unusual speech also gained attention. Instead, like most <a href=#>celebrities</a> of delivering a standard speech thanking family, agents and co-stars, he chose the unexpected route.</p><p>Hauser began rapping his thank you’s, and explained off-stage he’s actually kind of a rapper. Bombshell? Yes.</p><p>He told Entertainment Tonight that he has released music under a different name, and it’s even on <a href=#>Spotify</a>.</p><p>He said: “I love writing lyrics, I love being silly and I actually do rap music under the name Signet Ringer. It’s on <a href=#>YouTube</a> and Spotify and Apple Music</p><p>“There’s an EP with like six tracks of me actually rapping, because I enjoy doing that.”</p><p>Paul Walter Hauser also addressed what he was eating. It turns out, his managers gave him a packet of dried mangoes, as part of an inside joke. He warned them when cameras were on he’d start munching on them and that’s what he did.</p><p>Paul said: “[They] gave me a whole bag of mangos before the show started, I was like, ‘Dude, the moment the camera’s on me I’m going to start eating those.”</p><p>He then confessed he did it as a ‘shout out’ to them.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-i-didn-t-go-to-acting-school>‘I didn’t go to acting school’</h2><p>The I, Tonya star also paid tribute to the late Ray Liotta, who passed away suddenly in May 2022. They only had ‘one day on set’ together, but it still meant a lot to the <a href=#>Hollywood</a> star.</p><p>Although the Emmys has taken place in the middle of <a href=#>award shows</a> season, it was actually scheduled to take place last September. However, the writers and actors strike had pushed it back to January. The 2024 Emmys is set to return to its usual scheduling this fall, so we’ll get two this year.</p><p>Paul confessed: “I only got to work with him one day on set. We did a tiny little thing together, but… for somebody like me — who loves movies, who really watches a lot of movies, and that was their entry into the business. I didn’t go to acting school. I didn’t have family in the industry. I just had a Blockbuster card. You know what I mean? And Ray Liotta, if you look at Something Wild and Goodfellas and Field of Dreams and Copland and Narc, he’s so scary in the movie Narc. I just think he was one of our great actors.”</p><p>“I put him up there with like the Chris Coopers and stuff, where every time they show up, I’m happy to see them in a story.”</p><p>“So I love shouting him out for his talent, but he was also super kind to me,” Hauser added. “I think he’s at a much better party right now.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-paul-s-proud-photo-with-his-emmy-was-also-unusual>Paul’s proud photo with his Emmy was also… unusual</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/01/GettyImages-1928399610-1024x683.jpg><p>He’s just a quirky guy.</p><p>When he got up to stage for his gong, the first thing he said was ‘my wife loves your show’ to a passing actor. Most movie stars will start with ‘thank you’, but it makes him more relatable.</p><p>When it got to after the stage appearance, it’s time to pose backstage with their awards.</p><p>For Paul Walter Hauser, if you think him eating during the Emmys was strange, he took his shoes off for the photoshoot too.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2aDcLHMprCsZaCWwq151pqjrZ2iYrWiwdKeqWadkam2r7OMsJ%2BipJVixKq6zaKloGWZqHqrwdKtZK2nn2K%2FprjArZibpJVk</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./sofia-vergara-confronts-interviewer-who-seems-to-critique-her-english.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sofia Vergara Confronts Interviewer Who Seems To Critique Her English">&larr;
