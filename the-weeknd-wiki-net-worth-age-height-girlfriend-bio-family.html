His birth name is Abel Makkonen Tesfaye. Even before he grew up Abel’s father left him and his young mother who had to work very hard to support the young boy who was going to grow up and entertain the world.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/The-Weeknd.jpg><p>After his father had left and later started another family elsewhere the greatest responsibility for caring for the young Abel fell on his grandmother since his mother who now found herself with the task of caring for the family had to do several jobs.</p><p>For his studies, the Canadian singer attended Samuel Hearne Middle School and from there he began his high school studies at the West Hill Collegiate Institute. Then he moved to Birchmount Park Collegiate Institute but he didn’t finish high school before he decided to stop when he was 17 to give music all he got.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Drake’s Girlfriend, Dad, Sister, and Mom</a></strong></p><p>During his childhood, he always listened to a wide variety of music which will influence his singing style in the years to come. Moreover, his life was not without its pitfalls since he came into contact with drugs when he was very young before getting things straight.</p><p>Looking back at the beginning of his career which as we have said was influenced by what he listened to as he grew up The Weeknd experimented by merging rap R&B soul and everything he could gather in the songs.</p><p>His first attempt to sell himself worldwide came in 2010 when he made the song What You Need and posted it on YouTube.

This is all the more true since the album contained some songs from the singer’s House of Balloons album. This gave him enough publicity for Universal’s Republic Records to sign him. 2012 saw the release of his previous work Trilogy but this time there was already good ground for him and it went platinum. His next work Kiss Land was released in 2003. Despite everything the singer remained hidden from the audience because of his shyness and insecurities.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/The-Weeknd-Performing.jpg><p>Since then he has become a great sensation both as a solo artist and when working with others. Many of his songs such as Can’t Feel My Face and The Hills became popular with fans in his album Beauty Behind the Madness in 2015. His next album was Starboy. This album was another great success and earned him a Grammy nomination.</p><p>For all his hard work The Weeknd has several awards to show including two Grammys for Best Contemporary Urban Album for Beauty Behind the Madness and Best R&B Performance for “Earned It (Fifty Shades of Grey)”.
