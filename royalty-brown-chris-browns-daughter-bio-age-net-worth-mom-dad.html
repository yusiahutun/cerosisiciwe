Born of a famous rapper father, Royalty is already a superstar in her own way, in the showbiz world and beyond. Here you will learn more about the young star kid.</b></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Royalty Brown Biography (Age)</strong></h2><p>Royalty was born of Nia Guzman and R&B singer Chris Brown on May 27, 2014, in Texas, USA. She is the only daughter of her parents and the first child. Royalty is of American nationality and belongs to African-American, Mexican and Puerto Rican ancestry. Her rapper father is of African-American origin while her mother is of Mexican and Puerto Rican origin.</p><p>Further details about Royalty’s life and education are not subject to public scrutiny, so it is almost impossible for us to tell you more about the famous young Star.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Morgan Lily Age, Height, Parents, Where Is She Now?</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Here’s Everything You Need To Know About Royalty Brown</strong></h2><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Her parents</strong></h2><p>Royalty’s parents are hip-hop legend Chris Brown and former model Nia Guzman. The latter became pregnant with the singer in 2014 after a brief fling between them. The friendship between Nia and Chris, who had been friends for years before the pregnancy, did not lead to the marriage as they called it before their baby arrived.</p><p>Chris learned that he was the father of Nia’s baby in 2015 after a DNA test proved that the child came from his loins. At the time, Brown had a long-term relationship with the American actress and model Karrueche Tran, who dumped him immediately after publicly acknowledging that Royalty Brown was his child.</p><p>Royalty’s father was born Christopher Maurice Brown to Clinton Brown (a correctional officer from the local prison) and Joyce Hawkins (a former daycare director) on May 5, 1989, in Tappahannock, Virginia.</p><p>The iconic singer grew up with his older sister, Lytrell Bundy, who is a banker. Brown is famous for his roles in the music industry as well as for assaulting his Barbadian singer, songwriter, actress and singer Rihanna in 2009.</p><p>The R&B singer’s admission of guilt, in this case, earned him five years probation and six months of community service. During his musical career, he has released eight studio albums, one hundred and six singles, eight mixtapes and nine promotional singles. Chris Brown’s major musical influence is Michael Jackson.</p><p>Royalty’s mother, Nia, was born Nia Amey, in Corpus Christi, Texas, United States, on July 22, 1883. She first caught the public’s attention because of her intimate relationship with Chris Brown. Guzman, who makes the bank a role model, is a student nurse and currently lives in Los Angeles, California, USA.</p><p>In August 2016, she lost the battle for full custody of her daughter following a court decision that entrusted the Royalty to her parents. The court also ordered Nia to reimburse the R&B singer for the lawyer’s fees he had paid him.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Professional Life</strong></h2><p>As the daughter of renowned music artist Chris Brown, Royalty has developed a large fan base at an early age. Her father’s reputation in the industry and his nickname ‘Roro’ have been major contributors to her fame. Since she was born, Royalty has made headlines due to her celebrity parentage; this was confirmed by Chris Brown on his Instagram page shortly after news broke out about him becoming a father.</p><p>Chris Brown’s daughter, Royalty, made headlines when she was born and it wasn’t until several months later that DNA tests were conducted to confirm her paternity. During the early days of her life, Chris was dating model Karrueche Tran and her mother had a relationship with King Ba. The public knew very little about Royalty until she turned one year old but over time has become popular among Chris’ fans after appearing in various news reports and interviews alongside him.</p><p>Royalty Brown is a rising star known for her presence on various social media platforms. She is also connected to King Cairo Stevenson, the son of popular rapper Tyga and model Blac Chyna. Since her birth, Royalty’s Instagram handle has been managed by Nia under the name @missroyaltybrown. In August 2016, Chris Brown and Nia Guzman were granted joint custody of Royalty with Chris being able to meet his daughter 12 days out of each month; he has even dedicated an album in honor of his daughter which demonstrates how much he loves her.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Controversy&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Nia has accused Chris of being the cause of Royalty’s asthma diagnosis and reprimanded him for smoking around her daughter, citing it as a detriment to her health. Despite this, Chris denies any wrongdoing and insists that he cares deeply about Royalty’s well-being.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ:&nbsp;<a href=#>Anna Kendrick’s Height, Weight And Body Measurements</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Royalty Brown’s net worth</strong></h2><p>The child star’s fortune is estimated at $160 million, according to reports.

Nia has always maintained that Chris Brown is a bad influence on their daughter. She warned the rapper to stop smoking around Royalty because it seriously affects her health.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Body measurements</strong></h2><p>Royalty Brown is very beautiful, like her parents.
