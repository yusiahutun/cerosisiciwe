With each new season of the game, the plot gets better and more interesting with themes such as time travel and the existence of the multiverse.</p><h2>Is Fortnite based on a true story?</h2><p class=align-left>No, it is not based on a true story. Even though the game offers some imaginative stuff, some people think it's based on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">real-life occurrences</a>. However, the only common phenomenon between <i>Fortnite</i> and real-world battles is gun fights and paratroopers.</p><p class=align-left>Rumours about the game being inspired by a true story have been making rounds on the internet. People on different social media platforms have posted memes to prove how ridiculous the game's story has become. While it was all meant to be a joke, some have believed the meme, thus alleging that the game is based on a true story.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/95c82960d9eb400c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Is The Green Mile based on a true story? Here's what we know</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Fortnite is a fictional story featuring several characters from different fiction works. Originally, it was established to compete against a grittier realistic take on the battle royale genre known as PUBG. Nonetheless, it also drew inspiration from a highly-acclaimed movie, <i>Battle Royale</i>.</p><h3>What is the game Fortnite based on?</h3><p class=align-left>The game was inspired by the dozens of Battle Royale games that have been in existence for years. The <i>Fortnite</i> genre is a familiar idea considering the existence of games such as<i> COD: Warzone, PlayerUnknown’s Battleground, </i>and the<i> BR</i>. In addition, movies such as <i>The Condemned </i>(2007) and <i>Battle Royal </i>(2000) have also been in existence.</p><p class=align-left>The representatives of <i>Fortnite</i> revealed that Minecraft was another huge source of inspiration for their game. The idea of building<i> Fortnite </i>was derived from Minecraft and this heavily influenced its functioning in saving the <a href=#>world</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/544bad48a42792ec.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Will Willis from Forged in Fire?

According to the art director of the game, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Pete Ellis</a>, it was not supposed to be the goofy battle royale it has turned out to be today.</p><p class=align-left>Even though horror-centric action can still be seen through characters like The Husk, things have been steadily changing. With new developments, creators have turned the game into a more cartoonish and family-appropriate style.</p><h2>Fortnite mode and reception</h2><p class=align-left>The game was made and distributed in three modes.
