It just doesn't make sense. She is a veteran veterinarian and joined Pol Veterinary Clinic in 2015. If you want to see her again, you better watch reruns of the reality TV show. But does Dr. Emily get paid for reruns?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/3e4b5698290c96f5.png><h2 class=table-of-contents__title>TABLE OF CONTENTS</h2><p class=align-left>No show airs in perpetuity, and there is always an ending or an exit of a famous personality the audience loved. Dr. Emily left the television show for <i>The Incredible Dr. Pol</i>, which is still ongoing. You can only catch a glimpse of her in reruns. So, how much does Dr Emily make per episode of the reruns?</p><h2 id=524948-who-is-dr-emily-from-the-incredible-dr-pol class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Who is Dr. Emily from The Incredible Dr. Pol?</h2><p class=align-left>Dr. Emily <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">became famous</a> after appearing on <i>The Incredible Dr. Pol</i> as a regular cast.

Dr. Emily has a degree in Doctor of Veterinary Medicine. She majored in extensive animal field services and equine reproduction. Once she <a href=#>completed her studies</a>, Dr. Emily went to South Carolina and started practising as a veterinarian.</p><p class=align-left>Dr. Emily has a lovely family of three children: India, Oscar and Calvin. She’s been married to Tony for more than 14 years now, and the exciting thing is that they met and fell in love in <a href=#>high school</a>.</p><h2 id=524948-how-long-was-dr-emily-with-dr-pol class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>How long was Dr Emily with Dr Pol?</h2><p class=align-left>Dr. Emily <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">joined Pol</a> Veterinary Services in 2015 after she migrated to Weidman, Michigan.

I was sick of working [at her previous veterinary position], and we were in our second rental house…My friend, a tech at the clinic where I worked, pushed me to apply to Dr. Pol when she saw the ad Dr. Pol had placed.<p class=align-left>Once Dr. Emily <a href=#>started her role</a> at Pol Veterinary Services, she was impressed by the speed at which Dr. Pol saw patients. She immediately got the hang of it, as she wasn’t spooked by anything.</p><p class=align-left>Dr. Emily took on every challenge courageously, treating large farm animals while pregnant with her second child. Over time, Dr. Emily became a fan favourite because of her grace under pressure.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/fb284952a4cdd07e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Tiffany Pollard's fiance?

However, the TV show's producers and Emily have yet to reveal the amount. Dr Emily's earnings per episode were more than $10,000; therefore, it is highly plausible that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Emily is earning </a>below this amount.</p><h2 id=524948-how-much-does-dr-emily-make-per-episode class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>How much does Dr Emily make per episode?</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/44131473d84b5275.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>General Hospital comings and goings rumors, news, and updates</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Dr. Emily earned an average of $18,000 per episode while working at Pol Veterinary Services and appearing on <i>The Incredible Dr. Pol</i>.</p><h2 id=524948-what-does-dr-emily39s-husband-do-for-a-living class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>What does Dr. Emily's husband do for a living?</h2><p class=align-left>Only a few knew that Tony, Dr. Emily's husband, worked with her at Pol Veterinary Clinic.

Tony detailed his typical work day on his wife’s blog.</p><p class=align-left>“I have just unlocked and opened the front door to the clinic, and four to six owners with their animals in tow would pour into the little lobby . . . If the patient I pick happens to be deemed the most exciting case by the film crew, everything slows down…The doctors were rarely done seeing appointments by 5:00; if Emily left the clinic by 6:00 p.m., the staff wouldn’t leave until around 7:00 p.m.</p><h2 id=524948-where-is-dr-emily-thomas-now class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Where is Dr Emily Thomas now?</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6a92734ef367841a.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kara Santorelli's car accident: Here's what really happened</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Dr Emily Thomas left <i>Dr. Pol</i> because of the stress of working there with three <a href=#>small children</a>.
