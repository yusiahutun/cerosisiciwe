While you might not be able to find luxury items from the world's top brands, Chinese shopping sites that can ship products to the US are great for cheap electronics, basic clothing, and items for around the home.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Here are the best Chinese shopping sites that ship to the United States.</p><h2 id=aliexpress>1. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">AliExpress</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/aliexpress.jpg><p>AliExpress is arguably the most well-known Chinese online store. With revenues of over $55 billion, it's also the largest; it earns more than five times more money than eBay.</p><p>Unlike Amazon, AliExpress doesn't sell any products itself. Instead, it's an e-commerce platform connecting you with third-party sellers. The sellers are predominantly based in China, but there are also vendors in other South-East Asian countries.</p><p>Many vendors offer free shipping, but deliveries will take longer to arrive. You can also use DHL, UPS, FedEx, and other international couriers, depending on the seller.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you're thinking about making a purchase, make sure you check out our <a href=#>guide to avoid scams on AliExpress</a> before you hit the "Buy" button. But make no mistake, <a href=#>AliExpress is a legit Chinese online shopping site</a>.</p><h2 id=banggood>2. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Banggood</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Banggood-online-shopping-site.jpg><p>We spoke about Banggood when we reviewed the <a href=#>best sites for buying cheap electronics</a>. Although electronics are the site's main focus, you will also find sports equipment, fashion accessories, jewelry, and health products.</p><p>The business itself has been around since 2004, making it one of the older Chinese sites that ships to the United States. Besides the US, Banggood is a well-known Chinese shopping site that ships products globally, save for a few territories.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some orders qualify for free shipping. Again, however, be warned that free deliveries can take a long time to arrive. We're talking months, not weeks.</p><p>Banggood supports several payment methods. Credit cards, wire transfers, and PayPal are all supported, as are a host of third-party options like iDEAL and Dotpay.</p><h2 id=gearbest>3. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">GearBest</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/gearbest.jpg><p>GearBest is a newer Chinese online store than the first two sites we looked at. It has only existed since 2014.</p><p>The site has close ties with Chinese smartphone manufacturer Xiaomi and offers much better deals on the company's products than you would be able to find in a domestic store. Other categories that the site covers include Baby and Kids, Home and Garden, Appliances, Electrical and Tools, and Fashion, to name a few.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>GearBest is also great for non-US residents. The only two countries that it will not ship to are Palestine and South Sudan.</p><p>The site offers four shipping methods: <strong>Unregistered</strong>, <strong>Registered</strong>, <strong>Priority Line</strong>, and <strong>Expedited Shipping</strong>. American residents can use all four plans. Unregistered shipping is free and takes up to 45 days. The price of the fastest option—expedited—is calculated by weight. It takes three to seven days.</p><p>GearBest has some US-based warehouses, which can significantly reduce the time and improve the security of non-registered deliveries.</p><h2 id=dhgate>4. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DHgate</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/DHgate-chinese-shopping-site.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Headquartered in Beijing, DHgate is primarily a fashion site (though it does have a wide collection of goods across different categories from electronic, home items, and more available). If you're looking for cheap shoes, wedding outfits, watches, hair and grooming products, or bags, DHgate should be your first port of call.</p><p>The site ships worldwide. If you live in the United States, you can use DHL or one of DHgate's many local couriers. DHgate also has a local warehouse that can get an item to your door in three or more days, which is faster, and you don't have to deal with customs duty (at least not directly).</p><p>DHL should get your order to you within a week. Some lesser-known carriers, such as China Post Air and Singapore Post, can take more than a month. Despite that, it's one of the <a href=#>best shopping sites that ship internationally for free</a>.</p><h2 id=yesstyle>5. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">YesStyle</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/yesstyle.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sticking with the fashion theme, YesStyle sells menswear, womenswear, childrenswear, and lifestyle products. You'll find everything from maternity clothes to cosplay outfits.</p><p>Unlike some other sites in this list, YesStyle sells mainstream brands. However, they are predominantly Japanese and Korean labels, so they may not be instantly familiar to western audiences. People who have a particular fondness for fashion in Japan and Korea will like the site; it has sections dedicated to the latest looks in each country.</p><p>YesStyle offers free shipping on select orders, and it typically takes three to five days (Express shipping) or 10-14 days (Standard shipping).</p><h2 id=lightinthebox>6. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LightInTheBox</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Lightinthebox-chinese-shopping-site.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>LightInTheBox, along with sister site MiniInTheBox, ships to more than 200 countries around the world. It sells products across three core categories: clothing, small gadgets, and home and garden. The company was founded in 2007 and has gone from strength to strength. In 2013, it was even listed on the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>You can choose from several shipping options, all of which charge by weight. There is no free shipping. If you want to use a courier, LightInTheBox offers DHL, UPS, FedEx, and TNT. The estimated delivery time on LightInTheBox is four to seven days.</p><h2 id=shein>7. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shein</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Shein-chinese-shopping-site.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shein is another leading Chinese website for online shopping. It specializes in women's fashion, though there are also some menswear and children's products available. It's undoubtedly, one of the best Chinese clothing websites. One of the reasons for that is <a href=#>Shein's low prices</a>.</p><p>Shein only offers standard shipping and express shipping to the United States. Standard shipping costs $3.99 per order. If your order exceeds $29, shipping is free. Express shipping costs $12.90, but is free on orders above $129. According to the platform, P.O. Boxes and APO/FPO addresses can't use the express option.</p><h2 id=geekbuying>8. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">GeekBuying</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/geekbuying.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>GeekBuying is an electronics store. You'll find 3D printers, streaming boxes, wearables, smart security systems, tablets, and more. Like GearBest, it offers exclusive rates on Xiaomi smartphones. The site also has some "fun" electronics. For example, there's a section dedicated to remote control cars and another dedicated to electric scooters.</p><p>Unfortunately, you won't find all electronic devices on sale here, including smartphones (not even iPhones or the best Android phones), high-ticket computer parts like graphics cards, and more.</p><p>Shipping is free if you use standard delivery, which takes 15 to 45 days. Faster methods are available (taking two to seven days), but you must pay for shipping.</p><h2 id=rcmoment>9. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">RCMoment</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/rcmoment.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>RCMoment has a very specific focus–remote-controlled devices. You'll find gadgets like drones, cars, boats, planes, and robots.</p><p>Some products qualify for free shipping. If you want the fastest shipping, head to the US Warehouse section of the sites to see which products are already held on American soil. You can use Air Mail, EMS, DHL, or UPS to ship products from RCMoment, and orders take three to ten working days, depending on the selected option.</p><h2 id=dealextreme>10. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DealExtreme</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/DealExtreme-chinese-shopping-site.jpg><p>The last Chinese online shopping website on our list is DealExtreme. The site is up there with AliExpress in terms of popularity. It's been in operation since 2006 and ships its products straight from its Hong Kong warehouse.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Almost all the products are electronic. The breadth of products is impressive; you'll find everything from glucose monitors to tattoo guns. The site also sells lots of branded products. There are devices from SanDisk, Lenovo, Sony, Asus, and more.</p><p>DealExtreme offers free worldwide shipping on most of its items. Only select products have a shipping fee. However, if you want an alternative, you can ship express with couriers for an added fee.</p><h2 id=make-sure-you-shop-safely>Make Sure You Shop Safely</h2><p>Sadly, lots of online stores from the Far East have delivery problems in the US. Before you commit to a big-money purchase, make sure you scour the web for reviews of the store to make sure there are no ongoing issues.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGirmp9fmLWqusSsnGarmKS9sbXNoGSsoaSawG6%2Fx6KnZq2jZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./418422-who-highest-paid-motogp-rider-the-top-10-list-2021-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is the highest paid MotoGP rider?
