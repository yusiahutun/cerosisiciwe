Things got quickly out of hand and, high on methamphetamine, the trio began their protracted torture.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/05/27/c34b2760-7d24-11e9-8126-9d0e63452fe9_972x_183724.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sentencing the three men to life imprisonment, Justice Peter Nguyen said: “Never in Hong Kong in recent years has a court heard of such cruelty, depravity, callousness, brutality, violence and viciousness.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The horrific killing was widely covered in the media and the Chinese press laboured over the most macabre aspects of the case. This story does not intend to rehash those gruesome details, but instead ask why there was so much serious criminal activity in the 1990s and whether the violence of that decade played a part in the Hello Kitty Murder.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Former chief superintendent Barry Smith joined the Hong Kong Police Force in 1983 and within three years was assigned to the Special Duties Unit – nicknamed the “Flying Tigers” – an armed response team set up to counter terrorist attacks. He and his colleagues never had to handle a terrorist attack, but their training did mean they were well placed to deal with the violent crime wave in the lead-up to the 1997 handover of the British colony back to China.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/05/27/a66e2700-7d24-11e9-8126-9d0e63452fe9_1320x770_183724.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“There were fears that China would come in and clamp down on all areas, so the gangs felt they would use the relative freedom they had to make some big money,” says Smith, who retired from the force two years ago and now works as a security consultant.</p>One of the most notorious gangsters, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Yip Kai-foon</span></a> – known as “Teeth Dog” – led the first wave of violent robberies armed with an AK-47 assault rifle. More soon followed, with local triad gangs bringing in shooters from mainland China to support their audacious raids on jewellery stores in Kowloon and Central on Hong Kong Island.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“[The shooters from China] had more guts and courage and were less concerned about their welfare; they could be hired relatively cheaply. Every few weeks we’d get another case and would get a call to get armed up and go out,” Smith says.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Hello Kitty murder to the Jars Killer: five of Hong Kong’s most gruesome crimes</span></p></a></h3>Amid this crime wave was also “Big Spender” <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Cheung Tze-keung</span></a>, the mobster who organised a gang to kidnap Victor Li Tzar-kuoi, the elder son of Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing, and property tycoon Walter Kwok Ping-sheung. They got away with about HK$2 billion in ransom money.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Across the Pearl River Delta in the Portuguese colony of Macau, which reverted to Chinese rule in 1999, the leader of the 14K triads, Wan Kuok-koi – better known as “Broken Tooth” – waged a brutal war with rival triads for control of the enclave’s lucrative casinos.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hong Kong cinema reflected the underworld antics. Triads muscled their way into the film industry and produced their own movies, often intimidating and threatening directors and actors into working for them. Some of those films, such as <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">The Tragic Fantasy – Tiger of Wanchai</span></a> (1994), were about real-life triad members.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/05/27/8084467c-7d25-11e9-8126-9d0e63452fe9_1320x770_183724.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sun Yee On triad member Andely Chan Yiu-hing, who was nicknamed the “Tiger of Wan Chai”, was gunned down in Macau after taking part in a Grand Prix race.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Young and Dangerous (1996) told the story of a group of young gangsters struggling to make their mark in the underworld. It was slammed for glorifying triad societies, but it was nevertheless hugely popular and led to a series of sequels and spin-offs.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Hong Kong seems to have a love-hate affair with the triads. The film industry does glamorise them and make them out to be heroes,” Smith says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/05/27/34b68baa-7d26-11e9-8126-9d0e63452fe9_972x_183724.JPG><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/05/27/2f0708f6-7d26-11e9-8126-9d0e63452fe9_1320x770_183724.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He was a volunteer at Operation Breakthrough, a police initiative that uses sports as a means to help disadvantaged youth get on the straight and narrow. Smith ran the group’s boxing programme for 10 years and says there was a parallel dance programme for young girls.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Often you find with the young girls that they get attracted to the bad triad guys. They become the girlfriend and then they get involved with drugs, and so the cycle goes,” he says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This seems to have been the case with the 13-year-old girlfriend of Chan, one of the gangsters jailed for Fan’s murder. The teenager had run away from home the previous year, fallen in with a group of triad members and been introduced to drugs. By 1999, she was a regular at Chan’s flat – she joined Chan and his cohorts taking drugs, and watching porn and Hong Kong movies. The flat was bizarrely decorated with Hello Kitty merchandise, from sheets and curtains to the kitchenware.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/05/27/e03ff594-7d24-11e9-8126-9d0e63452fe9_972x_183724.JPG><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/05/27/cb7dce74-7d24-11e9-8126-9d0e63452fe9_1320x770_183724.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In May 1999, the 13-year-old turned up at a Tsim Sha Tsui police station complaining of nightmares. She said she was haunted by a woman who had been tortured and died in a Granville Road flat. The police initially did not believe her story, but when they followed her to the third-floor flat they found the gruesome evidence.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Was the Hello Kitty Murder, coming at the end of the most violent decade in Hong Kong’s triad history, linked to the brutality of the preceding years? Smith entertains the possibility.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I’m not a psychologist, but I’d guess that for the generation that grew up around that violence, almost every day, it might have had an impact on them. And watching films about it,” he says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/05/27/c705b878-7d26-11e9-8126-9d0e63452fe9_972x_183724.jpeg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Professor Karen Joe-Laidler is a sociology professor at University of Hong Kong and director of its Centre for Criminology, and her research has focused on youth gangs and drugs. She agrees that the murder fits in the framework of the period but believes the crime was an anomaly.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I get that it’s connected to this era of violent events in Hong Kong, but I see it as an isolated event that was in the context of heavy methamphetamine use and all the consequences that come with the chronic use of meth,” she says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Joe-Laidler says that the way Chan and his gang used the drug was typical of meth users – taking it in a small, private group.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">I’m not a psychologist, but I’d guess that for the generation that grew up around that violence, almost every day, it might have had an impact on them. And watching films about itBarry Smith</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When using meth, people can become quite aggressive because they are awake for long periods of time, not eating or sleeping. It creates a high level of irritability and paranoia,” she says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The violence of the 1990s is long gone, but the triad gangs remain an integral part of the city. Earlier this year, a wave of triad-linked violence forced the police to clamp down on local gangsters and boost intelligence gathering.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I think they are just as prolific in Hong Kong as they were. They are not as crazy in terms of what they do, in terms of shoot-outs, but they make a lot of money. I don’t think they’ll ever go away. They’re a part of Hong Kong fabric,” Smith says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He has recently been involved in teaching security tactics to guards at some of Macau’s leading casinos.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/05/27/1c02ed52-7d25-11e9-8126-9d0e63452fe9_972x_183724.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It’s an awareness programme. There is so little crime in Macau. When you walk around The Parisian or The Venetian, given the amount of money there is there, it’s amazing there aren’t more robberies or violence. It’s very peaceful. I don’t see why there would be a change,” Smith says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yip Kai-foon was due to be released from prison in August this year, but he died from lung cancer in April 2017. Cheung Tze-keung was arrested in China and tried and executed in December 1998.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chan’s teenage girlfriend was given immunity in exchange for testifying in court.
