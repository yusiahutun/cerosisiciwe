12-year-old son in scalding bath water.</span></p><p><span>Amaro Viana was murdered to prevent him from identifying the three housebreakers who carried out the raid in suburban South Africa.</span></p><p><span>The gang included the family’s gardener and the son of a domestic servant.<br></span></p><p><span>It was claimed they were motivated by the way they had been treated by the Viana family.</span></p><p><span>Appearing in court yesterday, the gardener Patrick Radebe, 24, confessed to being part of the gang which broke into their home in October last year.</span></p><p><span>Vereeniging Regional Court heard that, after gaining access to the house in Walkerville, a suburb of Johannesburg, the gang lay in wait for Amaro’s engineer father Tony, 53, to arrive home.</span></p><p><span>When he walked through the front door, they attacked him with golf clubs and a machete-like knife known as a panga before tying him up and ordering him to tell them how to open the family safe.</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/07/26/article-2179171-143A6A14000005DC-549_634x457.jpg height=457 width=634 alt="Twisted:
