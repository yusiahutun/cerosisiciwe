He faces the possibility of a sentence of up to one year in prison. Sentencing is scheduled for February 6. On two other charges, he was found not guilty of intentional assault in the third degree and not guilty of aggravated harassment in the second degree.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/jonathan-majors-2.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/jonathan-majors-3.png><p>Ross Kramer, an attorney for Jabbari, said they were “gratified” by the guilty verdict. “We are gratified to see justice served by today’s guilty verdict,” the statement read, per&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a>. “Ms. Jabbari testified publicly and truthfully, even though reliving these traumatic events on the witness stand was obviously painful. We are grateful to the jurors and the Judge for their attention and patience, and to the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office for their hard work and support.”&nbsp;</p><p>“Ms. Jabbari’s resolve to see this case through to the end demonstrates her tremendous strength and resilience. Unfortunately, for every survivor like Ms. Jabbari who comes forward to hold their abuser accountable, there are many others who believe that they cannot. We hope that her actions will inspire other survivors to speak their truth and seek justice,” Kramer’s statement added.</p><p>Majors was arrested Saturday morning March 25, 2023, in Manhattan, New York after a 911 call on suspicion of strangulation, assault, and harassment. The victim claims the defendant did “strike her about the face with an open hand, causing substantial pain and a laceration behind her ear,” according to the Manhattan DA’s office.</p><p>The woman was transported to a local hospital with minor injuries to her head and neck according to NYPD. She was in stable condition as of Sunday morning, March 26, 2023. That day, Majors was arraigned on several assault and harassment charges Sunday, the Manhattan DA’s office told&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>CNN.</a>&nbsp;On December 18, Majors’ guilty verdict was handed down by a six-person jury after around four hours of deliberation.</p><p>So where is Jonathan Majors’ ex-girlfriend Grace Jabbari now?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=where-is-grace-jabbari-now>Where is Grace Jabbari now?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Grace Jabbari has her Instagram on private. However after the trial ended, she posted on her Instagram stories.</p><p>“For my birthday, if you want.. a donation to @sffny, a charity that helped me so much this year, would be the best gift you could give,” she wrote in an&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Instagram Story</a>&nbsp;Tuesday, tagging&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Sanctuary for Families</a>&nbsp;New York. “Thank you so much @sffny, and everyone else…For everything.”</p><p>Additionally, there was a graphic that read, “New Yorkers: Get help today. Leave abuse behind” along with several organizations and their phone numbers.</p><p>Meanwhile, Jonathan Majors is breaking his silence after his conviction in a new interview with ABC News. His sentencing is set for Feb. 6. He faces the possibility of up to a year in jail for the assault conviction, though probation or other non-jail sentences are also possible.</p><p>“I wish to God I knew. That would give clarity. That would give me some type of peace about it,” he said.</p><p>He claimed he has never hit a woman. “I’m an athlete. I’m a sportsman. I know my body. I know how it moves. I know my strength, or lack thereof, you know? None of that was employed on her,” he said.</p><p>In a statement, Jabbari’s lawyer Brittany Henderson said Majors continues to “take no accountability for his actions”.</p><p>She continued, “The timing of these new statements demonstrates a clear lack of remorse for the actions for which he was found guilty and should make the sentencing decisions fairly easy for the Court.”</p><p><strong>If you or someone you know is experiencing domestic violence, help is available.
