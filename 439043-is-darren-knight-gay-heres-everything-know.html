Today, Darren Knight is one among many great comics, a self-proclaimed fastest rising comedian. He rose to fame through his humorous videos as his alter-ego Southern Momma. The character is now viral, and the comedian is celebrated for his comic prowess. However, Darren's kind of impersonation has led people to wonder whether he is straight?

Never miss important updates</strong></p><h2>Is Darren Knight gay?</h2><p class=align-left>Darren’s sexual orientation is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">one of the most debated topics</a>. The comedian keeps his life private, and not much is known about his <a href=#>relationship life</a>. Many people have suspected him of being gay because of his comic persona, Southern Momma. However, that is not sufficient to prove that he is not straight.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a94e67144349a2cb.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who are rapper Logic's parents? Everything you need to know</span></p></a><p class=align-left>On top of this, Darren is famous as a gay rights activist. The majority of his stand-up routines are directed to the LGBT community. Also, the renowned comedian has refused to talk about his sexuality in interviews.</p><p class=align-left>In an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview with HoustonPress</a>, he stated that he didn’t have an answer about his sexuality because he doesn’t know.</p>People have asked me about my sexual orientation, but I don’t really know.<p class=align-left>Darren Knight's social media platforms hardly have any clue about his sexuality as he posts images with numerous people of different genders. Therefore, it is hard to tell his stance. However, on 2020's Valentine’s Day, Darren posted an image of himself and a woman that went viral as most people speculated that the lady was his partner.</p><p class=align-left>Darren denied the dating rumours, furthering the speculation that he is gay. The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">comic had earlier stated</a> (in May 2019) that he is single and happy with his life, but this might have changed since it was more than one year ago.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c048078f820f740f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Regé-Jean Page: ethnicity, wife, net worth, movies and TV shows</span></p></a>I bought this big home, and like I said earlier, I am single, I don't have any kids…I felt like purchasing this house should be for someone who had a big family, so when I am home, I entertain a lot…I come from a BIG family, and since I don't have a family of my own, I don't let that stop me from bringing everybody together.<p class=align-left>Therefore, without Darren coming out about his sexuality, there is no point in labelling him as gay as he hasn't confirmed his stance. Thus, his sexuality remains a mystery until he opens up about it, but of course, the rumours will hardly end considering his private life.</p><h2>Is Darren Knight married?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e3a0ccbb28be263d.jpg><p class=align-left>Who is Darren Knight's wife? So far, the famous and <a href=#>fast-rising comic</a> hasn’t shown any signs of having a wife, let alone a girlfriend.

He said the following in an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview with Preview918</a>:</p>I like to say that 40 percent of Southern Momma is my mother and the other 60 percent is my grandmother because she’s a little more animated. She is a character and a hoot. So, Southern Momma is just a collage, really, of all the mothers I've known, including my sister.<p class=align-left>Darren Knight's mother initially did not like the character as she thought it would tarnish her family's reputation in the community. However, she noticed that it was picking up and making her son popular. Today, she is one of the character's biggest fans.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e170222373123f8d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Tony Hinchcliffe: Wife, gay, net worth, family, stand up comedy</span></p></a><h2>Quick facts about Darren Knight</h2><li>When was Darren born?
